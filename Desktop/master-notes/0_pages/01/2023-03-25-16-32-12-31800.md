## Text Processing in Linux 

emphaises on extracting & printing text by regex **line by line** in a text file. This means that each search can only based on the information provided by a specific lines.

## grep

*grep* (Global Regex Print) 

### Basic Search

1. search for the Regex "ERROR" and print those lines

2. search for Regex "start with 159884" and print those lines

### Inverted Search 

1. search for the Regex not "ERROR" and print those lines

### Match Regex, Find lines "after" and "before"

- `-A <n>` - match an Regex, then print n-lines "after" it
- `-B <n>` - match an Regex, then print n-lines "before" it
- `-C <n>` - match an Regex, then print n-lines "after" and "before" it
- Note - if there are multiple matches, it `grep` all the lines before/ after it


> [!Example]-
> 1. search for Regex "ERROR"; print that line & 2 lines "after" it

## sed 

*sed* (Stream Editor). sed is similar to grep but it doesn't only rely on Regex alone but use a "sed script" provided to the command line and run it against the contents: 

```shell

sed [OPTIONS] 'SCRIPT.sed' FILE ...

```

---
## awk

*awk* itself is similar to sed but more extensive because awk itself is a programming language. It is useful to process delimiter text data (i.e., easily handled using positional arguments). 

```shell
awk [OPTIONS] 'SCRIPT' FILE ...
```

The script takes in two inputs: 
```awk
pattern { action }
```
