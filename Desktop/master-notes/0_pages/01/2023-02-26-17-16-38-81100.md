# MapReduce Group By 

A MapReduce Group By on the Reducer side is similar to how [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-16-59-62600#Reduce-side Joins|Reduce-side Joins]] work. This is also taken on the fact that: 
- Mapper extract key from Records 
- Shuffle Stage group Records with the same "Group By Keys"
- Reducer collect Records with the same "Group By Key" from Mapper

A Group By operation can be done when Mappers extract the "Group By Keys" on a Table, then Reducer "aggregate" all the grouped Records:
