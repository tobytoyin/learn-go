## Jobs

A *Job* is a specific kind of containerised task that has a runtime lifecycle. By setting up a Job that executes the following:
- start up a container 
- use the container to run a Task until runtime completion

Basics settings: 
- `backoffLimit` - number of retry when the Job fails
- `activeDeadlineSeconds` - timeout the container 
- `restartPolicy` - what situation should a Job's container restart and retry

---
## CronJobs

A *CronJob* has the same spec as the Job with the additional template wrap with a `schedule`: 

```yaml
...
spec:
	schedule: "* * * * *"
	jobTemplate: 
		<JobSpec>
```
