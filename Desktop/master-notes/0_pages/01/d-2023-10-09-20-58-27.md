## Kafka's Distributed Streaming

Kafka's [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-29-17-06-35|stream processing]] is *Distributed Streaming System*. Instead of being able to setup Kafka Server as distributed cluster, this also has several implications: 
- fault tolerant as in a [[0_pages/01/d-2023-09-12-16-07-02|distributed streaming cluster]]
- [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-08-12-26-59|partitioning Topics]] and Messages storage enable distributed, large scale processing for both Producers and Consumers
- [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-08-12-26-59|partitioning Topics]] enable system to scale with hardwares

> [!NOTE]
> Whether Kafka is being setup as a single Server or a Cluster, the idea behind of its **partitioned Topics and Message storages is what making it a distributed streaming** system. 

As a motivation, below compares how non-distributed and a Kafka distributed streaming system under a single Broker paradigm.

## Non-distributed Streaming

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-10-09-18-57#^non-distributed]]

A non-distributed streaming system relies on a single Topic to handler and storages to handle request. For example: 
- Producers Topic's events are handled and write into a single Message Storage
- Consumers Topic's events are read and dequeue under the same Message Storage


This approach would work in a small-scale system but there several downfalls when implemented as a large-scale system: 
- degrade write performance - **new Messages can only stream into a single Topic queue**
- degrade read performance - **Consumers can only interact with a single/ limited Topic queue**
- difficult to scale up - as the Topic service is coupled with the Broker system, **Topic services can't scale along with more Brokers**

## Distributed Streaming

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-10-09-18-57#^distributed-kafka]]

A distributed streaming system like Kafka is able to resolve the disadvantages of a non-distributed system: 

- allow high frequency streaming - new **Messages can stream into multiple Topic partitions and its queues** without overwhelming a single Topic service
- allow high frequency read - **Consumers can interact with multiple Topic queues** and Messages can be dequeued without blocking other Messages
- *better Scaling up* - Topic services can be scaled along with more Brokers. Since Messages are partitioned and distributed, more Brokers enable Topics to scale along with clients (e.g., extra event streams, extra messages consumptions)
- *better Scaling out* - system can be scaled without affecting existing process and data among existing Brokers
