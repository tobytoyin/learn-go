# üìì Defining User-level Secrets Access

## Solution - Using RoleSessionName as Secret's Parameters 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230614120319.png]]

This assumes that each resource (e.g. Pod instance herein) is stateless about the user's identity and the only way this could fetch an user's own credential is by assigning a private `token` (more or less like an API token). 

This works like how API request would work in a stateless environment: 
- user in each anonymous Pod would use a `<token>` to create a new role session
- the new session's role principal `<id>:<token>` would be used to make requests to Secret Manager instead of the temporary session (`botocore-session-xxx`)
- Secret Manager use the `<token>` as parameter to fetch the User's specified secrets

To create a token paired with new secrets/ update secrets by token, we can use a [[0_pages/01/2023-07-08-16-27-16-28300|Lambda]] as an endpoint. This allows users to create, update, and distribute tokens to different other users.

## Alternative - Using Resource Tags

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230612120849.png]]

### YAML

```yaml
Resources:
  TeamASecret:
    Type: AWS::SecretsManager::Secret
    Properties:
      Description: Secret limits to some users/ roles
      Name: !Sub ${SecretPrefix}-team-a

  TeamASecretPolicy:
    Type: AWS::SecretsManager::ResourcePolicy
    Properties:
      BlockPublicPolicy: True
      SecretId:
        Ref: TeamASecret  # existing ARN or logical key
      ResourcePolicy:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
        - Resource: "*"
          Action: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
          Effect: Allow
          Principal: 
            AWS: !Sub ${AWS::AccountId}
          Condition:
            ForAnyValues:StringLike: 
             aws:ResourceTag/creatorUserId: 
              - "*:member-a@email.com"
              - "*:member-b@email.com"
```

## Controlling Resource Usage on Principals

### YAML

```yaml
Resources:
  TeamASecret:
    Type: AWS::SecretsManager::Secret
    Properties:
      Description: Secret limits to some users/ roles
      Name: !Sub ${SecretPrefix}-team-a

  TeamASecretPolicy:
    Type: AWS::SecretsManager::ResourcePolicy
    Properties:
      BlockPublicPolicy: True
      SecretId:
        Ref: TeamASecret  # existing ARN or logical key
      ResourcePolicy:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
        - Resource: "*"
          Action: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
          Effect: Allow
          Principal:
            AWS: 
              - <allow-role-arn-1>
              - <allow-role-arn-2>

## Controlling Resource Request by Users Groups

[[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-11-22-24-11-145|User Group Policies]]

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230608221951.png|600]]

This design here requires lot of re-architecturing on the existing Ferderate-users assumed role design.

## Existing Framework

The existing frameworks follows [[0_pages/01/2023-04-26-20-00-18-35900|Factory-Singleton Repository]] that relies on an single interface to retrieve secrets and pass down to another  database engine
