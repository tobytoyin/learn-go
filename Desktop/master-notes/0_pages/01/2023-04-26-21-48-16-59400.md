# Factory Pattern (Python Example)

To put it simply, a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-16-56-43-40300|Factory Pattern]] in Python is trying to convert the following code: 

```python 
from somewhere import MyClassA, MyClassB

# non factory approach 
object_a = MyClassA(...)
object_b = MyClassB(...)
```

Into code that doesn't require us to import, i.e., know the details about those class.

```python 
from somewhere import my_class_factory

# factory approach
object_a = my_class_factory('A')
object_b = my_class_factory('B')
```

The main benefit herein is that, a lots of additional imports/ details of class objects are masked from the factory. Also creating new classes through a function can be more effectively automated than class instantiation, e.g., passing new ENUMs.
