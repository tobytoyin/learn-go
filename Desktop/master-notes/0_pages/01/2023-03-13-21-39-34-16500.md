# PyArrow

When communicating data between systems, it is commonly comes in either Raw Data and Serialised Objects. 
- Raw data usually transmitted in text files that relies on [[Data Models]] to maintain consistency for different systems & softwares to use them
- [[0_pages/05/2023-04-27-21-27-38-44100|Serialised Objects]] (e.g., structured data) often needs to translate from one programming language to another in order to use them. 

In many big data applications, softwares are usually written in different programming languages. This is where *PyArrow* fits into: a cross-language tools to allow different languages's data objects to share with different software implemented by another languages.

## Core Different 

The core difference between a programming language data objects vs a PyArrow one is how they are represented: 


> [!Example]- Data Types & Data Model
> PyArrow defines an interface of different data objects in a standardised way and *enforce a Data Model* (i.e., schema). It also uses its own implementation of data type. So that objects from one language can be converted properly into another languages:
