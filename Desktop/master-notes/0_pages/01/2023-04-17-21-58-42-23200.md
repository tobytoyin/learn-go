- Using Runtime Configs in DAG

We might need to make a DAG to be a "service" that **allows different runtime configurations as input** and use them as Python variables to generate different DAG components, e.g., dynamic DAG, task id, input parameters etc.

---
## üìñ Use Cases Traits
- Runtime Dependent Variables (`airflow.models.Variable`)
- global data in the DAG context
- not streaming data among Tasks (this should be using XCOM instead)

---
## Code Example

Let say the DAG in this design needs to be these: 
- accept different inputs parameters (like payload in API requests)
- generate workflow dynamically based on inputs

Specifically we have a JSON like this and generate different tasks based on it:
```json
{
	"tasks": ["name1", "name2"]
}
```

Our code can be structured in this way: 

```python
@task
def get_runtime_configs(**context):
    conf = context['dag_run'].conf
    Variable.set('conf', conf, serialize_json=True)

    
with DAG(...) as dag:
    # setup config to a variable
    _ = get_runtime_configs()
    
    # retrieve config variable to define the rest of the workflow 
    conf = Variable.get('conf', 
	    default_var={}, 
	    deserialize_json=True)
    tasks = conf.get('tasks', [])

    operators = []
    for task in tasks:
        t = BashOperator(task_id=task,...)
        operators.append(t)
        
    # start all the operators
    chain(*operators)
```

- `get_runtime_configs` - get the input configs through accessing the `dag_run` in the context of the DAG and set them as *Airflow Variable*
- within the DAG: 
	1. first get the Variable that has been defined from the previous function
	2. retrieve the appropriate key 
	3. use the value to dynamically generate the rest of the Task

To run the DAG,  use "run DAG w/ config":

## Caveat

One major caveat for this approach is that every time a new payload being defined, it requires a second run to get the Variable and populate the dynamic DAG. 

This is because during the first run, the Variable hasn't been populated and exist in Airflow, i.e., the DAG only able to run the first `get_runtime_configs` Task.
