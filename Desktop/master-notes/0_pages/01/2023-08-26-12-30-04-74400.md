## Storage Classes

## Performance Enhancement

There are some common approaches to enhance S3 performances:
- *Horizontal Scaling & Parallelisation* - allow clients to GET and PUT objects in a distributed and concurrent approach
- *Multipart Upload* - allow clients to upload a single extra large object to S3
- *Transfer Acceleration* - utilise more bandwidth; allow long distance edged clients to transfer files to S3 with higher speed
- *Object Lock* - lock the objects to enable Write Once, Read Many to reduce latency

## Secured and Fault Tolerance

- *[[0_pages/05/2023-04-29-22-28-52-51900|Versioning]]* - allow objects to rollback or recover to a specific version
- *MFA deletion* - required MFA to delete objects to safe guard deletion by mistakes
- *Encrypted Bucket* - requires a new S3 bucket to encrypt objects at rest
- *Object Lock* - lock objects to prevent being overwritten or deleted by unauthorised users (governance mode)/ all and root users (compliance mode)

## Cost Efficiency

Cost of S3 objects are be optimised by creating *S3 Lifecycle Configuration*, which defines how S3 objects should move to different storage class based on the its time stored within S3.

## Contents Sharing/ Accesses

S3 provides several ways to share contents, most commonly: 
- *Pre-signed URLs* - provides a time-limited private links to access objects (similar to the "share as URL" in many cloud drive applications)
- *origin access identity* - allows Private bucket's objects to be shared through CloudFront without having to set the bucket to be Public
- *CloudFront signed Cookies* - set a Cookie on the client side, allowing them to access multiple shared files distributed through CloudFront
