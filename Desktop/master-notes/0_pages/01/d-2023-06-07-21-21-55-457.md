# üìì Packaging Lambda Modules with Containers

Packaging modules for Lambda functions are sometime difficult on local machines. Different CPUs might install and unpack modules differently: Mac often can't package properly modules for Lambda's linux. 


> [!tip]
> This generally won't happen with DevOps pipeline, which are all Linux based.

Using container ([official AWS image](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/)), this method aims to maintain consistency by: 
- install and pack modules using the same AWS environment (`awslinux`)
- containerised the process for reusability

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM amazonlinux:latest

RUN yum update && \ 
    yum -y install ${python:-python3.9} && \
    yum -y install python3-pip && \
    yum -y install zip

# setup current dir as working dir
# and allow user to mount it to package their project
COPY . .
VOLUME /working

# finally run the packaging script
CMD sh install.sh
```

## The Build Process 

1. Build the image locally by¬†`docker build -t lambda-packager docker`
2. Run the container to package by¬†`docker run -v $(pwd):/working --rm lambda-packager`
