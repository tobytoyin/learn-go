# K8s YAML 


Unlike `docker-compose` which always defines the infrastructure using a YAML file. ==Kubernetes YAML file defines a set of supports/ actions that needs to be perform in a cluster==. This could be creating resources, scheduling tasks, and different custom operations that a cluster needs to perform.

> [!tip]- YAML as API requests
> A straightforward way to understand K8s YAML is to think of it as a API request to a cluster and declare what needs to be done. ==Everything defines in the YAML are instructions that the K8s-api service need to perform==. 
> 
> In a API communication, software are communicates through JSON, e.g., `POST {payload...}`. K8s YAML as a more human-friendly tool allows these `{payload ...}` to be described in YAML.

## Manifest

A *Manifest* (aka *Object*) is a section of specification in a YAML file separated by `---`. This defines the contents of an API request. A single YAML can contains multiple Objects, i.e., API calls. When a YAML file is getting larger, Manifests can also be organised in multiple YAML files.

```yaml
# manifest 1
apiVersion: ...
kind: ...
metadata: ...
spec: ...

---
# manifest 2
apiVersion: ...
kind: ...
metadata: ...
spec: ...
```

## Object Keys

There are 4 keys that are required for every K8s YAML Objects: 
- `kind` - the API resources/ endpoint that needs to perform (see [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-24-34-92400|Resources]])
- `apiVersion` - latest API version of a specific resource
- `metadata` - unique identify of a YAML object, usually `name` or `UID`
- `spec` - the specification & details of the resource, the contents vary for different `kind` of API request we are making (see [[0_pages/02/2023-03-11-15-35-57-87900|K8s Spec]])
