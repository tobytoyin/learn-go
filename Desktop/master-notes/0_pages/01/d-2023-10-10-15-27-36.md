There are several approaches to make AWS databases in RDS [[d-2023-08-29-14-18-35|highly availability]] in AWS:
- [[#Enabling Multi-AZs]]
- [[#Read Replica|read replication of the database]]
- [[#Standby Replica|create a standby database]]
- [[#RDS Proxy|proxy to manage database connections]]

These approaches can make RDS service have a higher resilience during a [[0_pages/02/d-2023-08-10-12-04-08|disaster recovery]] and prevent high cost when database service has failed.

## Enabling Multi-AZs 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231013131953.png]]


An RDS database can be enabled as *Multi-AZs RDS*. This replicates and snapshot the same database into multiple AZs failovers. **When an RDS is offline in one AZ, this is automatically ensure all requests are routed to RDS in another AZ**.

## Read Replica 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231013143513.png]]

*RDS Read Replication* replicate a database for read query only. This load balances some read requests to the "Read Replica database" while the write transactions are handled by the Main database. 

Read Replica can be established in: 
- single-AZ - replicate a Read Replica in the same AZ as the Main RDS
- multi-AZs - replicate a Read Replica in a different AZ from Main RDS
- cross region - replicate a Read Replica in a different Region

This also ensure High Availability by:
- reduce the workload of the Main RDS, ensure transaction performance doesn't degrade
- promote reading from Read Replica when Main RDS is offline (*partial service available*)
- manually promote a Read Replica to be Main RDS; Main becomes Replica afterwards

## Standby Replica

*RDS Standby Replication* [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-37-35-93600|replicate a database]] for backup and standby mode only. The Standby Replica of RDS doesn't accept any write/ read requests but only maintain a "*standby connection*" to switch over in case the Main database is offline. 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231013204358.png]]

Standby Replication is conducted immediately when transaction is completed (aka *synchronous replication*) and backup from Main database into the Standby Replica.

---
## RDS Proxy

While Read Replica aims to handle high amount of Read query to RDS, a more general approach to handle high amount of RDS connections is to use *RDS Proxy*. 

RDS Proxy aims to manage the open connections between the Client and the RDS. Instead of opening new connections to RDS for every new queries, RDS Proxy manages a limited of connections pools and reuses them.
