# üìì CloudWatch Alarm & Notification

In some scenario, we want to have an application to catch exception and use [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-20-22-19-07|AWS CloudWatch]] as a middleman to raise Alarms. 

This is different in that: 
- decouple the error handling events from the application, and handle it in the Logging Layer (i.e., CloudWatch)
- not a predefined set of metrics that can be observed/ setup within CloudWatch Dashboard

---
## Design

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230623181834.png]]

A non-cloud friendly design (above) uses the Lambda/ codebase to handle all the error handling and notification process. 

We can change this into a more cloud-friendly approach by using CloudWatch as the logging and notification handling layer. 
1. Errors (unhandled errors) are caught in Lambda and raises as `[ERROR]` in CloudWatch
2. Logs are monitor and would raise Alarm when Error is found, i.e., passes threshold >= 1 Errors
3. Alarm would trigger an SNS Action, i.e., sending errors notification topic 
4. Subscriber of the SNS Topic would receive an email of the error

---
## Code Example

We want to have two kinds of errors: 
- `ExpectedException` - that are normal error that are handled by other operations/ return a 400 respond
- `Exception` - any other errors that are not handled and would exit the application unexpectedly

```python

class HandledException(Exception)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
	try:
		do_something()
	except ExpectedException:
		error_handler()
		return {'status': 400}
	return {'status': 400}
```

## Deployment Template

```yml
Resources:
	MyLambdaFunction:
		Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
		...

  ErrorTopic: 
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
    Properties: 
      TopicName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-error-topic       

  ErrorAlarm:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
    Description: CloudWatch Alarms for unexpected exception
    Properties:
        AlarmName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-error-alarm
        ActionsEnabled: true
        AlarmActions:
            - !Ref ErrorTopic  
        MetricName: Errors  
        Namespace: AWS/Lambda
        Statistic: Sum 
        Dimensions:
            - Name: FunctionName
              Value: !Ref MyLambdaFunction 
        Period: 300
        EvaluationPeriods: 1
        DatapointsToAlarm: 1
        Threshold: 1
        ComparisonOperator: GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold
```

The [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-20-22-19-07|CloudWatch]] Alarm `ErrorAlam` as to observe certain things: 
- `ActionsEnabled: true`  - allow Alarm to trigger Actions
- `AlarmActions` - is pointing to the a SNS Topic, implying a "send SNS" Action
- `MetricName` - is to observe `[ERROR]`
- `Statistic: Sum` - is to monitor the sum of errors over `Period` of time
- `Dimensions` - is to monitor only the Lambda one created
- `Threshold: 1` - is to check whenever there are at least 1 error observes, it triggers the Alarm

> [!Tip]- Getting the Alarm CFN
> We can get our custom CFN by creating/ testing the Alarm within CloudWatch, then export the YAML using "export Action source"

`ErrorTopic` is simply creating a new SNS resource for the Alarm to send to. We can also add Subscribers within the template but we can also create them within the UI to make the template more resource-focused.
