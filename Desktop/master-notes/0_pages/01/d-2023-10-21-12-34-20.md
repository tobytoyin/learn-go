## Common Approach

A common approach to handle Clients' transactions to a database is to directly allow Client's application to connect to the database's connection endpoints.

This approach is suitable for small-scale application with limited amount of transactions. But when the *throughputs* increases, this will degrade the performance of the database.

## Buffer Pattern

A better alternative is to have a *Buffer Pattern*/ [[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-29-22-16-46|Fanout Pattern]] to decouple the clients' requests handling from database transactions.

This depends on couple of components: 
- Message Broker System - which scale well with high throughputs (e.g., [[AWS SQS]], [[0_pages/01/d-2023-09-12-16-07-02|Kafka System]]) 
- Fleet of Consumer Applications - which are distributed to handle lower throughputs (e.g., [[AWS Lambda]])   

The main benefits of these components are that: 
- Message Broker System are able to handle high volume requests from clients' applications to handle unexpectedly high throughputs
- distributed consumers provides a steady transaction throughputs to the database
- the Message Broker System provides a "buffer" to slowdown the throughputs between the Clients and the database, and maintain a steady throughput rates to the database to maintain its performance
