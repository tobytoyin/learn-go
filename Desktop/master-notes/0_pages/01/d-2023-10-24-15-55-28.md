## ASG Configurations

An Auto Scaling Group has three different configurations: 
- *minimum size* - defines the least amount of instances required in a scaling group (*scaling lower bound*)
- *maximum size* - defines the maximum amount of instances a scaling group can scale up to (*scaling upper bound*)
- *desired capacity* - defines the initial number of instances required when a [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-20-22-19-07|scaling alert event]] is received (*initial scaling threshold*). E.g., when a scaling alert comes in, the ASG scale directly from 2 instances to 4 instances (but not to 3 instances)

## ASG Initial Setup

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231024161538.png]]^initial-setup

While ASG is responsible for scaling across AZs evenly, it doesn't guarantee the initial condition would be [[wip/d-2023-08-29-14-18-35|High Availability]]. To ensure high available of scaling instances across multiple AZs, the initial setup needs to provision the "minimum scaling size" instances into different AZs manually.

## ASG Scaling In Behaviours

Below are some conditions that ASG will keep when scaling in/ terminating instances (in addition to the scaling configuration rules):
- scaling is not in cooldown (default 5 mins cooldown for each scaling)
- keep at least 1 instance in each AZ
- keep protected instance alive 

Then termination rule apply in the following order until one is matched: 
1. removed instance(s) with the oldest launch template 
2. remove instance(s) with the next closest billing hours, e.g., `x.9 > x.2` 
3. remove instance(s) randomly
