A *store procedure* is a script (as an [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-08-29-82800|transaction]]) that is stored within a Snowflake schema object. It uses a general format: 

```sql
-- Header 
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE my_procedure(
	[ param PARAM_TYPE ]
)
RETURNS { RETURN_TYPE }
LANGUAGE SQL
AS

-- declare immutable varaibles
DECLARE
	...

-- start transaction
BEGIN
	-- contents of my transaction
	RETURN { my_return };
END; 
```

To use it, we can just call the Procedure: 

```sql
CALL(my_procedure, param)
```
