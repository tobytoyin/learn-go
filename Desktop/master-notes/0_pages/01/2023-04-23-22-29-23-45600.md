# News Summary - 2022-04-23

Automobiles technology are leaning more towards the software side:
- consumers are expecting better "travelling experience" (e.g., in-car entertainment technology)
- instead of "driving experience" (mechanical excellence)

Big Car companies have advantages when integrates software into their car well: 
- existing system designs/ architecture are well tested/ refined to be efficient

Big Car companies are not likely to build the entire software in-house and rely on: 
- outsourcing/ partnership with tech companies 
- integrate existing technologies by 3rd party companies, as big-techs are not exactly car companies

In-car softwares are expected to follow these trends: 
- extension of existing digital lifestyle/ profiles into their cars 
- a new type of CarOS & ecosystem that keeps evolving overtime
- CarOS that can integrate well with existing daily technologies, e.g., smartphones, social medias, etc. 

### üí° Thoughts

For car companies, the winner would likely be: 
- successful transition from mechanical excellence focus to software integration focus
- capability to adopt agile development into organisation: quickly evolve and roll-out new features into their in-car software, rather than the existing all-planned approach in design cars 

### For tech companies: the winner would likely be: 
- seamless integration of their softwares/ tech devices into different cars
- strong capability in creating high user experiences software (Apple > Google)
- owner of various entertainment technologies, which can integrate as in-car software
