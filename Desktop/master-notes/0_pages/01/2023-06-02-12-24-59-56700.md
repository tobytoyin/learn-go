# Function Overloading in Python

*Function overloading* is a way to do pattern matching base on the [[0_pages/03/2023-03-20-12-19-29-31000|functional signature]]. Specifically how a function should behave when inputs being different expected types.

This kind of function is called *generic function*, which take Types as parameters and response differently on it. We can also think of this as **pattern matching** based on input types.

## Precise Functional Signature 

`typing.overload` mainly aims to **make functional signature cleaner**, so that a function can clearly indicate what types of inputs would lead to what types of outputs: 

```python
# without @overload
def add(a: List[int] | int, 
		b: List[int] | int) -> List[int] | int :
	# logics when a & b are both int
	# logics when a & b are both List[int]
```

The above code has a unclear signature, as it doesn't convey that the function can accept "list of integers" and "single integer" clearly. Using `@overload` can make the signature more precise: 

```python
@overload 
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int: 
	...

@overload
def add(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> List[int]:
	...

def add(a, b): 
	# logics when a & b are both int
	# logics when a & b are both List[int]
```

In this case, the `@overload` decorator makes the signature more precise that: 
- function accept integers and return integers
- function accept list of integers and return another list
- the `@overload` only indicates as functional signature type but not actual code
- `add` is actual code implementation

## Dispatching Functions

When types become more complicated and we need lots of generic functions to handle different types. It would be ideal to decouple the type handling from the code logics. In this case, we can use [[0_pages/02/2023-03-26-00-03-46-99000|Single Dispatch]] to do this.
