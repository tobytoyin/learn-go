## A way to handle my obsidian catalogs

My images are in stored in catalog files as: 

```txt
![[image_file_name]]^some-id
```

My files reference the catalog file and reference the image by: 

```txt
![[c_filename#^some-id]]
```

To upload the image to storage bucket, I can: 
1. get the catalog filename as variable `c_filename` 
2. for each `![[image_file_name]]^some-id` images in the catalog file: 
	1. find `image_file_name`
	2. rename `image_file_name.ext` to `{c_filename}-{some-id}.ext`
	3. put the new file into a staging folder
3. sync the staging folder with the storage bucket

To allow online markdown to render that image: 

1. for each `![[c_filename#^some-id]]` : 
	1. format into object prefix as `{c_filename}-{some_id}`
	2. search for object `{c_filename}-{some_id}.*`
	3. replace `![[...]]` into `<img>{bucket_path}</img>`
