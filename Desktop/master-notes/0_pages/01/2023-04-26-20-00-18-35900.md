# Example of Using a Factory-Singleton Repository

In this work example, I implemented a "*Singleton Factory*" Repository design. 

---

## Problem Description

### Original Design

In this problem, I have a set of notebooks which are controlled by a single notebook (we call this Main) along with a set of notebooks which can be executed independently (i.e., each contains their own main method). 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230426202854.png]]

- each pipeline is configured to create a "production secret manager" by default. So if this go through an automated workflow, all the pipelines would create and using the Prod Secret Manager
- If a pipeline needs to run **manually & independently**, the param can be changed in a specific pipeline to create a "test secret manager" ([[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-16-56-43-40300|Factory Pattern]] + [[0_pages/04/2023-03-13-21-39-49-96800|Repository Pattern]])
- (these secret only works in a particular environment)

### Problem

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230426203012.png]]

The major problem in here, is that if we need to run the Controller **manually**, then the Controller would create a Test Secret Manager. However, the rest of the pipelines won't work because: 
- within the script, they are still configured as "Production Secret Manager"
- we cannot effectively change all the script because it is reading from a READONLY S3 bucket

In other word, the rest of the pipeline's **factory behaviour doesn't reflect the settings configured by its predecessor**.

## Solution

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230426204155.png]]

A solution to this is to make the Secret Manager Factory to become a [[0_pages/05/2023-03-12-16-55-04-34900|Singleton]] Factory, this has several criteria:
- the Factory class would lock the first instance of Secret Manager
- instantiating a new factory would return the singleton factory if presents

This makes it possible to allow: 
- any script that create the first (appropriate) SecretManager instance would store and lock inside the private SingletonFactory
- the other dependent pipelines that are trying to create a new Factory would point back to the SingletonFactory. Hence the Factory can only create the fixed SecretManager instance created

## Pseudo-codes

```python

class SingletonFactory:
	"""Singleton class to make the factory to return 
	   the fixed instance 
	"""
	__factory_instance = None

	def __new__(cls):
		# when initialising the factory
		# check if create a new one/ return an 
		# existing one
		if not cls.__factory_instance:
			cls.__factory_instance = cls.__FactoryInstance()
		return cls.__factory_instance

	class __FactoryInstance:
		"""Singleton class to fix the created instance"""
		_singleton_secret_manager = None

		def get_secret_manager(self, type_, **kwargs):
			if self._singleton_secret_manager:
				return self._singleton_secret_manager

			# rest of the return logics
			self._singleton_secret_manager = CreateInstance()
			return self._singleton_secret_manager

```
