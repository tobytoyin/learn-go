When using Unix based softwares, we can often chain (`|`) different softwares outputs together: 

```bash
echo "hello world" | awk '{print $1 ", " $2}'

>> hello, world
```

This is by following the [[0_pages/02/2023-03-11-15-37-15-78300|Unix Philosophy]], Unix software follows these approach in creating softwares: 
- [[#Uniform Interface]]
- [[#Separation of Logics & Wiring]]
- [[#Functional Executions]]

## Uniform Interface

Programs generally have the same way to represent the data without any complicated data structure. For example, most Unix programs use write space and new lines to separate output contents. 

This approach reduce the dependency on complicated integration tools and simplify the I/O process to just a few parsing tools. 

---
## Separation of Logics & Wiring

This means the processing logics only concerns itself with the data/ inputs provided and generated the appropriate outputs

This decouple the concerns of where the location of the inputs or outputs (these are handled by *Connectors*)

---
## Functional Executions

All inputs are *immutable* and can be safely compute outputs to the next stage without affect the original state of the input. 

This has the advantage to allow for:

> [!example]- Experimentation
> Since inputs and immutable and outputs is always the same. It allows easy experimentation by replacing any functions in the pipe with something else.

> [!example]- Debugging Friendly 
> Since every functions in the pipe should output something, it allows easy debugging and examine the intermediate outcomes.

> [!example]- Pause & Restarts
> Since Inputs & Outputs only concerns itself with the data contents, every stages outcome can be saved. This allows stages and pipeline to pause for the others and restart based on the saved intermediate outcome.
