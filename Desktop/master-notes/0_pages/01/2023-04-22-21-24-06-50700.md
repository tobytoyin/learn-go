*Off-Heap* is all the memories that doesn't belong to Heap memory and mainly reserved to support and maintain the lifecycle of JVM application.

---
## MetaSpace 

*MetaSpace* is a memory that store the pointers and reference of different Java objects, metadata of Java classes when they are running in JVM. 

---
## Stack Memory

*Stack Memory* is a memory for the "call stacks" of different Java objects. For example, the orders of how different Java objects, variables, methods should be executed. 

---
## Code Cache

*Code Cache* stores the compiled bytes code that can be run by the machine. For example, Java codes that are interprets; serialised Java objects created in JVM that need to be executed. They are compiled into machine bytes-codes and stored here. 

---
## Garbage Collector Data 

Java objects that are no longer needed in Heap and removed from [[0_pages/04/2023-04-20-23-03-40-71200#Full Garbage Collections|Full GC]] and store in here. Unused Objects are not entirely removed from JVM but are reserved as serialised bytes here; which could preserve the objects without taking more memory than as Java objects
