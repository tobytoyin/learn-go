## Broker System

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230712135700.png]]

A *Broker System* is a type of stream process system that additionally emphasise on:
- centralised stream metadata management
- centralised persistence storage for streaming data
- acts as a streaming buffers, allowing Producers & Consumers scale independently

This uses a *Broker Service*, which handles the Records generated by Producers and persistent Database storage to store the Records.

Producers write Records to Broker; Consumers read (poll) Records from Broker. However, Producers and Consumers are not directly communicating, it depends on additional implementation to trigger the polling from Consumers side. 

This approach is good for: 
- fault tolerant since all Records are stored inside Broker
- some level of batch processing and better events orders
