In a [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-29-17-06-35|Broker System]] like Kafka, there are several building blocks we need to start and configure before start using our applications: 

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-10-09-18-57#^kafka-single]]

A valid Kafka Server requires two servers to be running: 
- *Kafka Broker* - encapsulates the capability to handle (read & write), manage (queueing) of streams events and Message storages
- *Zookeeper Server* - a [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-41-40-19700#Metastore at the Master Node|Node]] that is used to maintain all the metadata of a Kafka Server

Another of one of these components being not online will result in a shutdown of the entire Kafka Server. For example: 
- no active Kafka Broker - Kafka clients cannot interact with Kafka
- no active Zookeeper - Kafka cannot access metadata for its topics and partitions

To increase the resilience of a Kafka Server, there are several approaches to do this: 
- [[#Kafka Cluster]] - replicating and running multiple Kafka Brokers instead of one
- [[#Zookeeper Cluster]] - replicating and running multiple Zookeepers instead of one

> [!Note]- Producers & Consumers
> *Producers* and *Consumers* are not part of a Kafka Server. They are *Clients Applications* that can be used to interact with a Kafka Server. I.e., a Kafka Server can be running without Producers and Consumers but not vice versa.

## Kafka Cluster 

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-10-09-18-57#^kafka-cluster]]

A *Kafka Cluster* is simply a Kafka Server that relies on running multiple Brokers Nodes instead of single Broker. Using this approach, this ensures that: 
- service is resilience - reduce chances of having no running Brokers Nodes
- data is resilience - data are replicated to multiple Brokers

As the Message storages are distributed among multiple Brokers Nodes, a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-38-17-65500|quorum]] needs to exist through Leader election. This ensures: 
- replicated [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-08-12-26-59|partitioned Topics]] among Broker Nodes are up-to-date
- maintain a single Controller to connect with Zookeeper and distributed clients' requests

## Zookeeper Cluster

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-10-09-18-57#^kafla-zookeeper-cluster]]

Another fault tolerant measure to keep a Kafka Server alive is to ensure Zookeeper Service and Brokers are always able to read metadata from Zookeeper. 

This approach simply relies on having a *Zookeeper Cluster* (multiple Zookeeper Nodes running) instead of a single Zookeeper.
