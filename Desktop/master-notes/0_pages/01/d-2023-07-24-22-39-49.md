We can use image recognition to classify [[0_pages/04/d-2023-07-23-21-15-34#Candlesticks and Current Trend Stage|types of candlesticks]], i.e., large body/ large shadow. For example, within a time window, which type do each candlestick classify into (i.e., body & shadow size wrt to that time window). 

And combine this information into (simple) pricing information to predict the next trends within certain intervals? This allow us to simplify this machine learning problem from a "image-to-trend" prediction problem, to a "image classification" and pattern matching prediction problem.
