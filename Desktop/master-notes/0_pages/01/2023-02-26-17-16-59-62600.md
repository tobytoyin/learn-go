# MapReduce Joins 


When a database needs to conduct Join operation on two tables, it would use a Foreign Key of one table and lookup for the Index of another table to conduct a Join. This process generally is done row by row because Index lookup is generally quick in a (transactional) database.

## Inefficient Way to Join

Because [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|MapReduce's Records]] don't implement any Index, there is no way for MapReduce to do a linear lookup. This means using traditional database approach for Joins ==require every Record's Mapper to exhaustively do a "*full table scan*" to search for the matching Foreign Key on another Table==.

Other table heavy lots of repetitive scan (every Record's Mapper scan the same Table over again). This would also have lots of performance issue when making large amount of connections with another Table (every Record's Mapper make one connection).
