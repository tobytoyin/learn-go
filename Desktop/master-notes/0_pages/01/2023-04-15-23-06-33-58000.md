# Creating Reusable Components in Taskflow API

Some examples on how to create dynamic Tasks using [[0_pages/04/2023-04-15-22-30-55-70800|Taskflow API]]

---
## Dynamic Tasks with Dynamic Metadata

It is often for Tasks to perform same kind of logics on different inputs/ parameters, along with different metadata to differentiate the Tasks (e.g., `task_id`). 

Using a classical DAG approach, it is often required to define the same objects with different `task_id` multiple time. With `task` decorator, each Task's metadata can be override programmatically: 

```python
@task
def common_task():
	# this task function is resuable
	...

@dag
def some_workflow():
	starter = common_task.override(task_id='start')()
	task1 = common_task.override(task_id='task_1')()
	task2 = common_task.override(task_id='task_2')

	starter >> task1 >> task2

```

## Common DAG with Dynamic Configs

Sometime different workflows share the same common skeleton and differ only by theirs configurations (e.g., `start_date`, `schedule`) and their Tasks. 

We might define one common DAG skeleton inside a `/common` module as:

```python
# some common script
def common_workflow():
	# same workflow but with different configs
	...
```

In different DAGs schedule, we can import and define the configurations separately: 
```python
from common import common_worflow

@dag(**some_custom_configs)
common_worflow
```
