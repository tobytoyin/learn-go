# AWS Step Functions    

## What is a Workflow?

![[3_hidden/_images/work-flow-20230102170935.png]]

The simplest form of [[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-17-28-36-24300|Workflow Automation]] can be thought as a _“input → process → output”_ procedure. While a more complicated process chains up different multiple processes or decisions along the way to switch between different process.

For every process, we need to have some _resources_. For example, “what kind of machine we need to run this program?”

## AWS Step Functions

AWS *Step Functions* (*State Machine*) is a programmatic way to describe a [[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-17-28-36-24300|workflow]] by the use of different AWS services as resources and terminology. It is written in a form of nodes and how different nodes are connected to perform a workflow.

1. Input of a workflow is indicated as `StartAt` which defines the initial input of the whole process
2. Process along the workflow is defined as `States` which can be _Tasks_ or _Choices_ in general: 
	- *Tasks* - take an AWS resource and start a process based on its inputs 
	- *Choices* - take the input and specific conditions to switch to the next State
	- There are also different other States:

3. The output from the process is chained to the next `State` by explicitly indicating the name of the next node using `"Next": <node-name>`, or indicating whether the node is the ending node

## Defining Step Function

Step Function are usually defined in a JSON file to indicate the hierarchical dependency: 

```json
{
  "StartAt": "<initial-input>",
  "States": {
    "<ProcessName>": {
      "Type": "<Process-Type>",
      "Resource": "<ARN-of-AWS-Services>",
      "End": "<end-node-process?>"
    }
		// more states when chaining up multiple processes
		// ....
  }
}
```

## Why Use Step Functions?

❌ Using chain/ callback of Lambda functions (_function chaining_) become too complicate to manage and catch which process (step) went wrong. It also makes it difficult to document and visual the workflow. 
✅  Simplify code maintenance by reducing the use of Lambda as events triggers when connecting to lots of other AWS services

❌ Using temporary database to manage states, or Queues to mange flow for function trigger would makes events/ states tracking, fault tolerance too complicated
✅  Simplify workflow orchestration to Step Function rather than on the services’ ends.
