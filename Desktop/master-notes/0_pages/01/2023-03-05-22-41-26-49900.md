# Knowledge Graph & NLP System  


-   The nature of sentence and languages is suitable to be represented by graph:
    -   many NLP techniques can easily parse structural information within a sentence: sentence tress for example
    -   The grammatical structure of a sentence already in a form of relationship between Nodes of words

## ‚û°Ô∏è NLP & Graph Pipeline

Based on the reading, the procedure in managing and creating [[Knowledge Graph|Knowledge Graph]] is a series of steps involving: 

-   üßä **Components of a Knowledge Graph System**
    -   a document ingestion pipeline
    -   an NLP tool with dependency parsing
    -   an NER model for recognising the key entities in the text
    -   a proper graph model to store the hidden structures extracted from the text in an easy to query data structure
    -   a graph database for persisting the dependency relationships as an intermediate step
    -   a set of Cypher rules for extracting entity relations
    -   another graph database for storing the inferred Knowledge Graph and its multi-database feature; this way we keep separate the relevant knowledge in one DB as a Knowledge Graph and all detailed metadata in another - helper - DB)
    -   the visualisation on top of the KG to deliver extracted insights to the end user

## üí° Idea about the System Design

![[3_hidden/_images/etl-process.png]] ^e04f0d

Base on the summary above, a Knowledge Graph system could be designed in such a way:

>[!info]- ETL Process
>- Doc Normalisation - requesting API to retrieve documents and normalise multiple content blocks into a single document; removing irrelevant text, etc.
>- Common NLP Tasks - using common NLP library to:
>	- extract the syntax tree: words orders, grammatical relationship
>	- raw words ‚Üí their lemma; generic meaning transformation
>	- NER ‚Üí to extract core entities in sentences and documents

> [!INFO]- Graph DB
>  The Graph DB is mainly for storing the outputs of the NLP tasks into Nodes:
>	- sentences/ paragraphs/ documents ‚Üí into specific Node type
>	- Named Entities ‚Üí into specific Node type(s)
>	- syntax tree grammars ‚Üí relationship between Named Entities & words
>Essentially with this Graph DB, users can convert each Nodes and Edges into a sentence and restore the original text.

>[!INFO]- Knowledge Graph
>The Knowledge Graph only stores organised abstraction of the sentence. For example:
>- inferred relationship between Named Entities
>- normalised relationship/ edges - different words that implying the similar information

## üöó Moving Forward
The main difficulty in a NLP-powered system is that Machine Learning is difficult to start without good labelled data and large dataset. In a small document database and system, it is easier to setup a Knowledge Graph with just [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-17-15-01-96400|Cypher]] Queries and organising useful information. 

When there are more data available, the pattern-based query and populating of Knowledge Graph can be transformed and supported by Machine Learning Models.
