This example showcases how to create a `hostPath` [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-21-20-47-58|Volume]]: 
- a `hostPath` as a external file system for the Pod
- a single Pod with one container - print out the files in the volume's file system

## 1. Create Dummy File into 

Write some random text to to Worker Node's own file system: 

```shell
mkdir /etc/my-dir
echo "Hello world" | sudo tee /etc/my-dir/myText.txt
```

---
## 2. Create the Spec

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: {{ podName }}
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox:stable
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'cat /data/myText.txt']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: {{ volumeName }}
      mountPath: /data

  volumes:
  - name: {{ volumeName }}
    hostPath:
      path: /etc/my-dir
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

In this manifest, we have several key aspects: 
- `volumes[0].name` - is the name of the Volume the Pod can use 
- `volumes.name[0].hostPath.path` - the path that hosting our external file system 
- `volumes.name[0].hostPath.type` - indicate the mount is a `/directory` and can create it if it doesn't exist in the Node's file system
- `.volumesMounts[0].name` - points to the Volume that the manifest specified
- `.volumesMounts[0].mountPath` - indicates which Container's directory the volume is mount on, i.e., `podHostPath:containerMountPath`

## 3. Run and Check

```shell
# create pod
kubectl apply -f <myManifest>.yml

# check the logs
kubectl logs <podName>
```
