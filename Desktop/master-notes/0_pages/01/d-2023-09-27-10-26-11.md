A *Transient Object* in Snowflake (e.g., [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-05-18-97000#🗓️ Table Objects|Transient Table]]) indicates several concepts compare to the "Persistent Objects": 
- *zero-copy clone* - data are only referencing to the same [[0_pages/02/2023-05-01-12-02-15-27800|underlying data]] with a different namespace. Therefore no extra storages are involved (unless new data)
- limited Fail safe protection - transient data are permanently gone when it reaches the data retention period. Another cloned objects is required
