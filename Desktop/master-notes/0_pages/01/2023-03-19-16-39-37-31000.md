We can use docker-compose to set up a Postgres database as part of the service of our application: 

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:

  postgres:
    # image to start to postgres database
    # we can use any postgres admin app to connect to host:5432
    image: postgres:9.6
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=<user>
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password>
    ports:
      - <port>:5432
  
  # ... other services 
```

Now we can run this compose file by using: 
```shell
docker compose -f 'docker/docker-compose.yml' up -d
```

Now we can access it by using either a DB admin app or its connection URI:

```python
uri = f'postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db_name}'
```
