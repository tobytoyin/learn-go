# K8s NodePort Example 

This is a note for the Interactive Tutorial of "[[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|Exposing Your App]]".

When we first use `kubectl get services`. This would return a Service named `kubernetes`. This is because the entire cluster needs a Network that wrap our all the Pods for the API to reach to, hence the `ClusterIP`

Now we can create a Service by making a deployment (i.e., creating a ReplicaSet) on an existing Pod. This Service should be accessed from the outside world ([[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500#^node-port|NodePort]])

1. Find the Pod that is running ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230103115948.png]]
2. Create a NodePort Service ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230103120107.png]]

We can examine the details of this Service: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230103120240.png]]

It contains the following key information: 
- the Pods in this Service is labelled as `kubernetes-bootcamp`
- this Service can be accessed through the `Endpoints`, which is `IP:TargetPort`
- it is a `NodePort`, so we can reach it outside of the cluster

If we try to make a network request with `curl`, this would return some results from the Pod's image:
