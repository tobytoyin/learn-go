# Cache vs Checkpoints 

The main difference between [[0_pages/01/2023-02-27-20-36-07-97200|cache and checkpoint]] is their *transformation lineage*
- For caches, the transformation DAG and steps are stored (**persevered lineage**) which the RDDs can be recomputed again when caches are gone. 
- For checkpoints, transformation steps are not persevered (**break lineage**) and should consider it as a kind of source data
- (see [[#^0d3047]])

## Use Cases

Because of this, the choice is often based on: 

| scenarios | uses | reasons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| off-loading JDBC tables/ queries | checkpoint| JDBC is often considered as source data anyway |
| complex aggregation | cache | to avoid heavy recomputation | 
| data sharing across applications  | checkpoint | permanent lifecycle in file system; avoid making complex & inter-winded application states |
