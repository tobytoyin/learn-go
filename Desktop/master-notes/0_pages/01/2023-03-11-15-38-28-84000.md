## Positional Arguments

*Positional Arguments* pass to a shell script are extracted using `$<position>`, for example: 
```bash
sh some-script.sh arg1 arg2
```

- `$0` - `some-script.sh`
- `$1` - `arg1`
- `$2` - `arg2`

## All Arguments

Sometime in a more complex scripts, we simply want to extract all the arguments, then them using some string manipulation. This can be done by using `$@`. For example: 

```bash
sh some-script.sh arg1 arg2
```

`$@` would extract all the positional arguments as string from the programme entry point, i.e., `arg1 arg2`

## Use Cases 

*Arguments Extractions* are command in shell scripts because this is how CLI retrieves commands. This is most commonly use along with:
- [[Shell Switch Statement|Switch Statement]] - base on arguments to invoke function in the script
