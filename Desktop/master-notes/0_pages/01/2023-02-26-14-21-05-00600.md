# EMR Cluster Architecture 

AWS [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-00-02-41200|EMR Cluster]] are structure into 3 different groups of Nodes: 

![[3_hidden/_images/architecture-20221226215626.png|400]] 

- ***Master Instance Group***
	- are groups of Nodes that are running the Driver (Master) Nodes 
	- are responsible to maintain the EMR cluster 
- ***Core Instance Group***
	- are groups of Nodes that are responsible for running [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-17-21-15-09800|Spark Cluster]] computation and [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]] storage
	- i.e., compute & storage
- ***Tasks Instance Group***
	- are groups of Nodes that are only responsible for executing Spark Tasks 
	- i.e., compute only

## Storage Architecture

As [[0_pages/02/2023-03-05-17-29-59-25300|Spark Workflow]] is highly dependent on writing & reading partitioned files, EMR cluster implements two types of HDFS as Spark storage backbone: 

- ***In-cluster HDFS***
	- EMR's HDFS is a "in-cluster HDFS", which builds up the entire storage from scratch
	- its ==lifecycle is ephemeral== and attached to EMR cluster, i.e., storage terminates when EMR ends
	- useful as a larger temporary storage for multiple Jobs than a in-memory storage
- ***EMRFS***
	- EMRFS is a HDFS which the storage connection to S3
	- allows Spark to interact the storage as HDFS rather than as S3 objects
	- data are persistent and permanently stored in S3 after cluster terminated
