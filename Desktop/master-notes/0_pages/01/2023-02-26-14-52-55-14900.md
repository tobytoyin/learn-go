# MapReduce Hotspots 

In different Reducer-side computation, computation are conducted based on *partitioning the same Key* principle: 
- [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-16-59-62600|MapReduce Joins]] - partitioning the same Foreign Keys
- [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-16-38-81100|MapReduce Group By]] - partitioning the same Group By Keys

When certain keys got [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600|skewed]] (more Records than other keys), these "*hot keys*" would slow down a MapReduce job because other (smaller) Reducers need to wait for the larger partitions to finish.

## Shared Joins/ Group By

A Shared Reducer approach is to allocate hot keys Records to multiple Reducers. 
- explicitly/ analytically indicate the hot keys for Mappers
- Mappers would shuffle hot keys Records into multiple partitions randomly
- (If Joins) all the other table (Right Table) Records are replicated into all hot key partitions
- Reducing stage + Additional Reducing Stage for hot keys results

## Mapper-side Joins/ Groups

Some framework (like Hive) would separately compute hot keys partitions by [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-16-11-46500|Map-side Joins]], while keeping other key partitions to Reducer-side approach.
