# Map-side Joins 

Map-side Joins emphasises on *offloading heavy computation*, i.e., large amount of data shuffling to Reducers, and focuses on re-organising data properly for the Mappers. 

This allows each Mapper machine to conduct a traditional database joins (lookup Foreign Keys in an Index Table) in a relatively small partition.  ^eda53d

## Broadcast Hash Joins

Broadcast Hash Joins focuses on the following: 
- "broadcast" (small) Tables to every Mapper partition
- each partition conduct a Join Keys lookup in the "Hash Table" of Records

This commonly used for *big table-to-small table* join, so that each partition can store the entirely small Table replication. Then within the partition, the Mapper is simply doing a Hash Table lookup to match Records with the same key.

## Partitions Hash Join

*Partitions Hash Joins* (aka *Shuffle Joins*) focuses on [[0_pages/05/2023-03-01-21-32-42-34200|rebalancing]] the input partitions first before the Mapping stage. This is usually done for *big table-to-big table* joins.

1. Records from both input tables go through a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-38-47-17000|non-deterministic Hash function]] that would produce Hash Index
2. Records with the same hash index are allocated into the same partition, i.e., if Records on both left and right table share the same join key, both of them would generate the same Hash Index and shuffle into the same partition. 

This ensures several things: 
- records that need to be joined/ grouped are "rebalanced" into the same partition
- each partition would be small enough to lookup Index Table efficiently for joins

> [!example]- Hash Index
> An example of using Hash Function to group Records into Partition: 
> In the Left Table:
> - `Record(JoinKey="key1") => HashKey("1")`
> - `Record(JoinKey="key2") => HashKey("3")`
> 
> In the Right Table:
> - `Record(JoinKey="key1") => HashKey("1")`
> - `Record(JoinKey="key3") => HashKey("1")` 
> 
> In both Tables, `"key1"` and `"key3"` Records would both allocate into Mapper 1, thus having a small partition to lookup the Index Table inside the partition.

## Map-side Joins Restrictions

Map-side Joins commonly have more restriction than [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-16-59-62600#Reduce-side Joins|Reduce-side Joins]] but can improve performance when use cases are satisfied: 

> [!example]- Large-join-small - [[#Broadcast Hash Joins]]
> We know about the size of the two tables in a distributed file system, one is larger and one small. 

> [!example]- Same Partitions Structure - [[#Partitions Hash Join]]
> Both Tables are using the same keys to partition in a distributed file system. For example, one Table is using "country" to partition different stores attributes; another Table is also using "country" to partition different stores transaction.

> [!example]- Downstream MapReduce Jobs - [[#Partitions Hash Join]]
> A join is conducted after series of MapReduce computation. For which the outputs composes of partitioned data that group Records with the same keys.
