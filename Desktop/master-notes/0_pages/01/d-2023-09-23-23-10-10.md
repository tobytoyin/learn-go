## What does `xargs` do?

Answer - it converts text files into [[0_pages/01/2023-03-11-15-38-28-84000|Shell Arguments]].

## Why?

Texts in Linux are handled as `stdin` and `stdout`, both are based on the idea of "file" within the terminal (see [[0_pages/01/2023-03-25-16-32-12-31800|Linux Text Processing]]). 

When using pipe `|`, outputs of the command are passed down as "file" through `stdin` and `stdout`.  However a file is not a appropriate arguments if we are piping into a function. In this case, `xargs` is useful to break down a text into positional arguments by a designated separator.

## Executing Commands
