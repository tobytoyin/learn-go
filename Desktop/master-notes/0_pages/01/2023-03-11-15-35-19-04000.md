When setting up the [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-35-38-89100|Apache Airflow]], there are several directories we need to look at/ modify:

## Setup DAGs Directory

Airflow uses a database to look up the Python DAG script in a specific folder, we can check where we should save/ copy our Python script, making it searchable by the Airflow database: 

```bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow

# check the dags directory and look for `dags_folder`
vim $AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg
```

The directory for `dags_folder` is usually `$AIRFLOW_HOME/dags`  and sometime we need to `mkdir` this directory first. We can can copy our DAG script into this directory: 

```bash 
cp <my-dag-script> $AIRFLOW/dags
```
