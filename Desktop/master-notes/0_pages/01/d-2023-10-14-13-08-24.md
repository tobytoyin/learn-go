## ELB with ASG

A typical use case for [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-06-12-53-13|ELB]] is to handle network traffics to an [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-24-15-55-28|Auto Scaling Group]] (*ASG*). By controlling the traffics volume to an ASG, it allows ASG to scale-up/ down EC2 instances: 
1. ELB perform health check on EC2 instances
2. ELB route traffics to healthy EC2 instances (ignore unhealthy one)
3. ASG independently checks the instances metrics with the Scaling Group: 
	1. when there are more traffics → metrics increase → ASG determines scale-up
	2. when there are less traffics → metrics decrease → ASG determines scale-down
