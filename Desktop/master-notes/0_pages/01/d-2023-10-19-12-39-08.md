## Query non Object 

When querying a non Data Object, e.g., String, Integer, ..., the query goes by: 

```graphql
{ endPoint(args: xxx) }
```

---
## Query Data Object

When querying a Data Object (schematic Object), a query needs to define what *field* within the schematic Object needs to be fetched. Then GraphQL **will resolve the query and returns on the indicated fields** in responds. 

```graphql
{
	endPoint(args: xxx) {
		fieldA
		fieldB
		fieldC
	}
}
```

---
## Query Mutation

When querying a `Mutation` Object (i.e., write/ update data), a query needs to define a query is a mutation query. This is similar to executing a `Query`:

```grpahql
mutation {
	mutationEndPoint(args: xxx, ...) {
		returnFieldA
		returnFieldB
	}
}
```

- header of `mutation` that differentiate it as Mutation Query
- call the mutation endpoint within the query string
- indicate the fields to return of the object returns from the endpoint

---
## Query Field within Field

In many case, a Data Object in GraphQL contains another Data Object with its own schema. For example: 

```graphql
type Person {
	name: String!
	location: Location!
}

type Location {
	name: String!
	size: Int!
}

type Query {
	getPersonDetail(name: String!): Person!
}
```

Under this schema, we have two Objects: 
- `Person` with `name` of String type and `location` of `Location` type
- `Location` with `name` of String type and `size` of Integer type

When a query is being made to `getPersonDetail` endpoint, we would expect this to return a full Object that nested like and contains all the information: 

```json
"data": {
	"getPersonalDetail": {
		"name": "my name", 
		"location": {
			"name": "City Name", 
			"size": 100
		}
	}
}
```
A Query can be efficient to **fetch just the data we need** in a complex Object like this, 
we can construct the query like this:
```grapql
{
	getPersonDetail(name: "myName") {
		# the field within the Person 
		name
		
		# specify the fields within the Location
		location {
			name
		}
	}
}
```

which would return a partial of fields that the client requires of: 

```json
"data": {
	"getPersonalDetail": {
		"name": "my name", 
		"location": {
			"name": "City Name", 
		}
	}
}
```
