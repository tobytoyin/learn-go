A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an approach to setup a "virtual" machine within physical hardwares' memory. When a JVM launches, it would take part of the memory (RAM) from the physical hardwares and allocated it for JVM usages (hence *JVM Allocated Memory*).

## JVM Memory Structure

As JVM is a reminiscent to the memory structure of actual hardwares, it also separates its memory structure into faster access & slower access (Since JVM is already allocated from RAM, both are pretty fast).

The *[[0_pages/04/2023-04-20-23-03-40-71200|Heap Memory]]* (similar to hardwares' CPU) provides the fastest memory for JVM and is the **main memory in JVM that stores Java Objects**. 
For example, when codes create variables, the actual data of those objects go to the Heap.

The *[[0_pages/01/2023-04-22-21-24-06-50700|Off Heap Memory]]* (similar to hardwares' RAM) provides a slower access and its memories are generally to support and maintain the lifecycle of the JVM: 
- code executions (Stacks)
- JVM's compiled codes
- objects referencing
