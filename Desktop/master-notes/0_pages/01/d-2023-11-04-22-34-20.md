Consider this sub-graph: 
- two `Actor` nodes
- two `Movie` nodes

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231104224738.png]]^agg-example

A "group by" aggregation in [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-17-15-01-96400|Cypher]] can be done from two different perspective: 
- group by aggregation based on unique Node entities
- group by aggregation based on Node's fields

In both case, "group by" are done using the `WITH` statement.

## Group by Node Entites

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231104225714.png]]^group-by-entity

Let say we want to return the `count` of Movies an `Actor` has acted in:

```cypher
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]>(m:Movie)
WITH a, count(m.title) as movie_counts
RETURN a.name, movie_counts
```

## Group by Node's Fields

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231104230008.png]]^group-by-field

```cypher
MATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]>(m:Movie)
WITH a.country AS actor_origin, count(m.title) as movie_counts
RETURN actor_origin, movie_counts
```
