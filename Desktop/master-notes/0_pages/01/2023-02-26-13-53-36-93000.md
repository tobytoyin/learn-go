# Designing EMR Solutions

There are several design aspects to consider when designing [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-00-02-41200|AWS EMR]] solutions: 

---
## üéª Job Orchestration

Manage the dependency between Spark Jobs, time schedule. 

-  [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-14-02-53-84300|AWS EMR]]  - Easy to maintain job dependency that utilise different AWS Services 
- [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-35-38-89100|Apache Airflow]] - Easy to maintain schedule & dependency for Jobs programmatically

---
## ‚öñÔ∏è Auto Scaling 

Scaling can be increase/ decrease the number of [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-14-21-05-00600#Cluster Architecture|Nodes]] of a EMR cluster. This would depend on whether scaling needs to be done when there are more data and storage (Core nodes); or whether there are more computation needs to be done (Task nodes).

## ‚è≥ Cluster Duration

A EMR cluster can have a long running or transient lifecycle: 

- ***Long Running Cluster***
	- Cluster won't turn off and keep running until being shut down
	- Because starting a cluster takes time, long running cluster is useful for application that needs to be on "standby" throughout the day
	- e.g., [[0_pages/05/2023-04-07-12-38-26-29900|streaming]] or transaction processing application
- ***Transient Cluster***
	- Transient Cluster starts and shuts down based on the lifecycle of an application, i.e., starts when Job starts & shuts down when Job completes

---
## üè™ Metastores Selection

Metastore is a key part to keep a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-33-82100|Distributed Storage]] partitions discoverable. 

- ***Hive Metastore*** (default) - 
	- The default metastore in an EMR cluster is a Hive Metastore which its lifecycle is ephemeral and ends with cluster tears down (see [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-14-21-05-00600#Storage Architecture|Storage Architecture]])
	- To avoid ephemeral, versioning and replica of the metastore can be integrated as a relational table in AWS Relational databases 
- ***AWS Glue Data Catalog***
	- A AWS managed metastore is persistent even after cluster tears down
	- This is useful to extend files being consumed by other AWS services outside EMR cluster

---
## ‚ùê Deployment Mode

Deployment can be done on EKS (containerised) and EC2:

- ***EKS Mode***
	- [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-13-57-53600|EKS]] deploys a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300|Kubernetes]] cluster can simplified deployment efforts, as builds and configurations of Nodes can be deployed into a cluster right away. 
	- This mode emphasises on "*containerised Node within a Cluster*"
- ***EC2 Mode***
	- [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-13-57-53600#üéª Orchestrate Containers on EC2|EC2]] cluster provides more customisation for a specific use cases at the expense of higher DevOps efforts. 
	- This mode emphasises on "*containerised Process within a Node*"
