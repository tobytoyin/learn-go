# PySpark - Unpersist 

At some point, when our [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-20-20-43600|cached data]] has served its purpose and no longer needed in memory. It is better to "uncache" it, so that we can free up some memory to cache other RDDs. 

- `df.unpersist()`  - uncache a particular assigned DataFrame
- `spark.catalog.clearCache()` - uncache everything 
- `spark.catalog.uncacheTable('tableName')` - uncache a SQL view

## Caution - The Address of Cached RDDs

In most PySpark, we would do something like this to "reassign variables" after one DF transformation. We might want to "uncache" the `df` after many transformations: 

```python
df = df.cache()  # cache data
df = transform1(df)
df = transform2(df)
df.write(...)
df.unpersist()  # cannot uncache
```

However, this would not work as expected because the *memory address* of `df` is no longer pointing to the cached DataFrame's memory address. We can check it by: 

> [!Example]- Checking the Mem Address
> ```python
> # cached df 
> df = df.cache()
> df.is_cached # > True 
> hex(id(df))  # > address #1
> 
> # after 1 transformation & reassigning variable
> df = transform1(df)
> df.is_cached # > False
> hex(id(df))  # > address #2
> ```
> -  the original `df.cached()` memory is stored at some location & its cached
> - the transformed `df` memory is stored at another location & its **not cached**
> - `df.unpersist()` is uncaching the later `df`, which it isn't cached in memory
>


### The Correct Way

The correct way to do this is to **assign a immutable variable** to the cached dataframe: 
```python 
df = df_cached = df.cache()  # cache data
df = transform1(df)
df = transform2(df)
df.write(...)
df_cached.unpersist()  # uncache properly
```
