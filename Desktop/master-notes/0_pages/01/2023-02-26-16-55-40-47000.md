# Basic K8s Housing Keeping 

Some useful command line to understand about your [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Kubernetes Cluster]] status: 

`kubectl cluster-info` gives you the address of the Control Pane. This provides us the access point when we need to interact with the cluster .

`kubectl get nodes` shows us what Nodes are available in the cluster. For example, the example below shows that we only have one Node call `minikube` which is the only Master Node in the Control Panel.

## Check Containers in a Pod

We are interested in getting all the `container.name` for a specific Pods:

```shell 
kubectl get pods <podName> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}' |\
tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | \
xargs
```

- `kubectl` - retrieve all the named `containers` within the `<podName>` Pod
- `tr` - replace spaces with newlines
- `xargs` - tidy the format

---
## Check Logs from a Pod's Container

When a Pod contains multiple containers, we need use the below. The `<containerName>` can be retrieved using [[#Check Containers in a Pod|this command]].

```shell
# this shows the log of the container with a Pod
kubectl logs <podName> -c <containerName>
```
