In Python, `dict` is not [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-15-28-13200|hashable]] because it is an immutable object. Therefore some operations are not allowed, e.g.: 

```python
items = [
	{'id': '100', 'name': 'item1'}, 
	{'id': '101', 'name': 'item2'}
]

# this would result in error
set(items)
```

In some case, a dictionary is desirable to be mutable and then freeze it to be immutable at some point. This is something that `dataclass` can't do since it needs to have all the static fields ready.

## FrozenSet

We can convert a mutable dictionary into `frozenset` in order to make it hashable:

```python
items = [
	{'id': '100', 'name': 'item1'}, 
	{'id': '101', 'name': 'item2'}
]

set([frozenset(item.items()) for item in items])
```

## Implement Pydantic Hashable

```python
class DocRelations(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")
    id: str
    name: str
    # other extra fields for extra properties

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        # return the hash of an immutable dictionary
        return frozenset(self.model_dump()).__hash__()
```
