## Input

```txt
[INFO] Hello World
[INFO] Hello World Again
[ERROR] Some Error in this application
```

---
## Pipeline

```ruby
input {
  # input source is coming from a file
  file {
    path => "/work/logs/hello_world.log"  # source of the log 
    mode => "read"  # read the logs
    start_position => "beginning"

    # logging what file has been completed and stashed;q
		sincedb_clean_after => 0
    file_completed_action => "log"
    file_completed_log_path => "/work/outputs/hello_world/finish.log"
  }
}

# "output" destination of the log
output {
  # capture the output into json format
  stdout { codec => "json" }

  # output destination is a new file
  file {
    path => "/work/outputs/hello_world/output.json"
  }

}
```

- `sincedb_clean_after` - cleanup the `sincedb` allowing the same logs to be rerun

## Output

```json
{
  "@version": "1",
  "host": {
    "name": "99be43463011"
  },
  "log": {
    "file": {
      "path": "/work/logs/hello_world.log"
    }
  },
  "event": {
    "original": "[INFO] Hello World"
  },
  "message": "[INFO] Hello World",
  "@timestamp": "2023-11-10T14:50:52.146620630Z"
}
...
...
```

In this simple Pipeline, we convert three logs into a single file with three JSON entries. Each JSON entries populated the following information:
- `event` - the source input and the log data
- `message` - the output of the Logstash pipeline. By default all the events are identified as `%{message}`
