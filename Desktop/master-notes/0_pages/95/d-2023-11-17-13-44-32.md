## Getting Started

A *Logstash Pipeline* is an ETL process that consists of three stages: 
- E - `input` - the input source & input handling
- T - `filter` - optional transformation steps to wrangle, populate Fields, etc. 
- L - `output` - the output destination (sink) of the pipeline

## Basic Command Lines

Logstash executable is stored at the below directory and can be used to start Logstash daemon to start running pipeline: 

```shell
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash  # this start Logstash daemon
```

We can also alias this to make running this simpler: 

```shell
# add this to your profile, e.g., ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc
alias logstash="/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash"
```

Logstash pipelines by default are stored under `/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf`. Without configuring it, new pipelines need to be placed under this directory and run the pipeline using the below command: 

```shell
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/myPipeline.conf
```

Running pipeline files that are stored in different location is possible. This can be modified at `/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml` by adding new pipeline ID and its respective paths (see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/multiple-pipelines.html))

## Hello World Pipeline

At minimum, we can explore how Logstash works using interactive stdin and stdout: 

```ruby
# /etc/logstash/conf.d/hello-world.conf

input { 
	stdin {} 
}

output {
	stdout { 
		codec => rubydebug
	}
}
```

This indicates: 
- input resource come from the terminal's input from users, i.e., `stdin`
- simply print out the output back to the terminal after being parsed by Logstash

To execute this pipeline, run the below command, then start typing in our "log":

```shell
export alias logstash="/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash"
logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/hello-world.conf
```

## Improved Hello World Pipeline

We can then refine our pipeline by adding `filter` to transform our input. This is a good way to purposely learn about how different plugins (see next section) behave: 

```ruby
# /etc/logstash/conf.d/hello-world-imp.conf

input { 
	stdin {} 
}

filter {
 # adding more plugin to try
}

output {
	stdout { 
		codec => rubydebug
	}
}
```

## Learning New Plugins

Different operations on Logstash operates as Plugins, you can find build-in plugins documentation from [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/introduction.html). Plugins are referenced and bounded by: 

```ruby
filter {
	grok { # plugin config }
	mutate { # plugin config }
	# etc ...
}
```

Each plugin having different syntax reference but they follow shared some common syntax. Most commonly:
- `%{field}` - reference a Field that has already been populated, e.g., `%{message}`
- `key => someThing` - hash map, table, key-value pair etc. Usually `key` is either some configuration keywords, or operates on a specific `field`
