To copy the entire page in Neovim, you can use the following command in normal mode:

```
gg"+yG
```

Here is what each part of the command does:

- `gg`: Move the cursor to the first line of the file.
- `"+`: Use the system clipboard register.
- `y`: Yank (copy) the text.
- `G`: Move the cursor to the last line of the file.

This command will copy the entire contents of the file to the system clipboard, which you can then paste into another application.

I hope this helps!
