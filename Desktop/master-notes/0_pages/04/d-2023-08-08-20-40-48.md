[[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-22-55-31-12300#Multiple Semi-Structured Records|Loading Semi-structured data]] usually involves Nested Data. This are accommodated with *flatten* and *path querying* operations to make the data normalised. 

Consider the following Data Model: 

```json
// 1 entity (row) JSON
[{
  "book_title":"Food",
  "year_published":2001,
  "authors": [
	{
    	"first_name":"Fiona",
    	"middle_name":null,
    	"last_name":"Macdonald"
  	},
 	{
    	"first_name":"Gian",
    	"middle_name":"Paulo",
    	"last_name":"Faleschini"
  	}
	]
 }]
```

## Path Querying

In Snowflake, semi-structured data are prioritised as "store first, query later". While traditional data warehouse ETL usually involves normalising and processing semi-structured into single columns during the ingestion process, Snowflake makes use of `VARIANT` type to store the entire object and retrieved them while needed. 

### Root's Field

To query the first field at the root, level, we can use the following syntax:  

```sql 
-- access field + enforce type
SELECT column:year_published::integer FROM myTable; 
-- <column>:<field>::<castType>
```

### Indexed Items Field

When a Data Model exists array of entities, we can use *index value* to query the item. The benefit in doing this in Snowflake is that even when the index querying doesn't exist, it will return `null` instead of throwing errors.

```sql
SELECT RAW_NESTED_BOOK:authors[0]:first_name
FROM NESTED_INGEST_JSON;
```

## Flattening

*Flattening* (along with *exploding*) semi-structured can be done using `FLATTEN` command, which takes a target field that needs to be normalised to (regardless whether fields contains a generic type or array type). E.g.,
- `root:field1` - normalised up to `field1`
- `root:field1:field2` - normalised up to `field2`

Complex join operations are usually involved after flattening normalising (see [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-18-03-33-51600|flatten-unnest]]). In Snowflake, we can take advantage of subqueries to **perform a row-index left-join on the same table after flattening**:
- the use of [[Lateral Join]] (which extract a transformed column and index-left-join)
- extracted a column (columns can be referenced after `FROM table`) as a Table and index-left-join 

```sql
SELECT value:first_name
FROM     
    NESTED_INGEST_JSON, 
    TABLE(FLATTEN(input => RAW_NESTED_BOOK:authors));  --index-join
```
