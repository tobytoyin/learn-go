AWS Web Application Firewall (*WAF*) is an endpoint level firewall. 

## Vs NACL

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-16-21-04#^waf|c-2023-09-16-21-04]]

Comparing WAF to [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-05-22-41-21-618|NACL]], NACL mainly protects network traffics between the network source to AWS VPC/ AWS resources. 

Whereas WAF, it provides network protections at a different level and behaviour: 
- security and controls at endpoint level (before travelling to VPC or resources)
- provides network monitoring on incoming traffics
- sophisticate rules to block and filter network traffics base on [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-29-15-51-26|L7 network contents]] (e.g., application's payload)

---
## Common Filtering Rules

- *Rate base* - apply blocking on IPs that has high frequency & volumes of traffics
- *SQL database rules* - AWS managed rules to prevent SQL injections on the app
