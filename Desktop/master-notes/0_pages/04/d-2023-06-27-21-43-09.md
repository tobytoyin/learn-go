An Input-Output (IO) interface emphasises on using `Reader` and `Writer` abstraction interface: 

These [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800#Composition Design ("HAS-A" relationship)|abstraction interfaces]] are useful because there are many different files types being developed and use. It is impossible for programmes to create different functions to have different standard to retrieve string or bytes from files. For example, an anti-pattern would be: 

```python
# this is a bad design pattern without reader interface
def read_file(file_path, file_type):
	if file_type == 'json': 
		return json_reader(file_path)
	if file_type == 'txt':
		return txt_reader(file_path
```

These interfaces allow different implementation of Reader and Writer to have their own logics to handle different file types. For example, `json` would have a `JsonReader`; `txt` would have a `txtReader`. Programmes can reliably depend on `Reader` and `Writer` interface to handle string/ bytes reading and writing. For example: 

```python
# reader can get contents regardless of different file types
def read_file(reader):
	contents = reader.read()
	reader.close()
	return contents
	
```
