*Artifact* in [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-20-21-24-33|Github Actions]] represents an object within the workflow that would be used along the CI/ CD pipeline, e.g.: 
- `.zip`, `.whl` files to install in a Python package

## Creating & Upload Artifact

In this example, I used `poetry build` to create a `.whl` artifact for my module. The below does these: 
1. use a Poetry image to `build` and create `.whl` file (see [[0_pages/01/d-2023-09-21-22-04-47|here for Poetry setup]])
2. upload the `.whl` files in poetry build `dist/` to Github Actions Workflow

```yaml
# ...jobs steps
      - name: Install & build .whl
        run: |
          poetry build

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: my-artifact
          path: |
            dist/*.whl
```

## Download and Using Artifact

In the above pipeline, an artifact named `my-artifact` is created within this account. We can download this artifact and install it via pip: 
1. download the `my-artifact` into this Runner under `/libs` path
2. do a `ls` to get the full paths; filter out `.whl`; `xargs` into arguments for `pip3`

```yaml
# python setup steps ...
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: my-artifact  # 
          path: ./libs

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip3 install $( ls -d ./libs/* | grep .whl | xargs )
```
