## Object Type

An *Object Type* in GraphQL defines the most type of data/ entity with the GraphQL system. An Object Type is not a concrete data but its an abstraction aims to describe: 
- the *Scalar Typed Fields* of an entity (e.g., String, Integer values of an entity)
- the relational *Object Typed Fields* to another entity


> [!Tip]- Abstraction Class
> If we are familiar with many REST tool, this the Abstract Base Model that describe the expected inputs/ outputs of object

If the data we have contains a graphical one-to-many relationship between two entities, as below:

A GraphQL can help to represent this in a statically and simple way: 

```graphql
type Post {
	title: String!
	author: Person!
}

type Person {
	name: String!
	posts: [ Post ]!
}
```

This defines the data structure of a `Post`, including: 
- `title` - an required String field
- `author` - an required `Person` field, which links to another Data Schema

This defines the data structure of a `Person`, including: 
- an required String field `title`
- a list of `Post` field called `posts`

## As Wrapper to Data Layer

Because Object Schema is just an abstraction, any kind of **data that are being retrieved from external systems (e.g., databases, other APIs) can be converted & mapped** into a specific Object Type. 

This mapping process is the responsibility of GraphQL query handler (aka [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-19-10-26-08|Resolver]]).
