- *Formatted Storage* - are storing data that an Operating System needed, e.g., fault tolerant of OS shut down, operating system files etc. 
- *Allocated Storage* - are storage that reserved for applications. They are not used by the main application but it is needed to provide fault tolerant, roll-back, versioning, etc.
- *Consumed Capacity* - are the storage that is actually being consumed and storing application core data, e.g., user data/ media files etc.
