# Candlestick Basics

![[c-2023-07-23-21-54#^candle]]

A *candlestick chart* can provide more context than line/ bar charts. A candlestick consists of two parts: 
- *body* (box) - indicating the interval (usually daily) open/ close price
- *shadow* (line) - indicating the interval max & min range

Generally looking at the two components we can have some understanding on how the market agreeing on the price & its fluctuation. For example: 
- looking at the Body, it can indicate the "settled" price of a stock
- looking at the Shadow, it can indicate the overall **volatility** of a stock

## Basic Interpretations

There are two ways to interpret candlesticks chart: 
- [[#Basic Market Behaviour|overall market behaviour]] - looking at a single candlestick (mostly its Body)
- [[#Basic Market Trend|overall market trend]] - looking at multiple candlesticks as time-series (its Body and Shadow interactions overtime)

## Basic Market Behaviour

![[c-2023-07-23-21-54#^single-stick]]

- Short Body Size - generally indicates a price *equilibrium*. This is because the within a day, the final price haven't changed much, implying that the market is agreeing on the price
- Large Body Size - generally indicates that the market *disagree* on the price and causing it change

## Basic Market Trend

A *market trend* can be simplified into 3 stages:
- *Start of Trend* - certain pattern that indicates a start of a price change trend (a trend can persist or simply noise)
- *Strong Trend* - a trend momentum that changes the price overtime
- *Slow Trend* - a trend stabilised/ dying out, and price changes are mostly settled

When analysing a Trend, it is important to know: 
- what stage the trend is currently at (start, middle, end), and whether we can profit at this stage? 
- what trend/ direction can I expect? Do we expect the trend to continue, or die-off?

### Candlesticks and Current Trend Stage 

Using single & combination of Candlesticks, it might reveal how the current market behaves and suggests what stage of a trend the stock is currently at. I call this *4 types of candlesticks* and each has some Body-Shadow Ratio as rule-of-thumb: 

![[c-2023-07-23-21-54#^4-types]]
- Type A - Small Body (50-50 ratio), suggests a stabilised price 
- Type B - Small Body (20-80 ratio), suggests a Start of Trend/ Noise
- Type C - Large Body (80-20 ratio), suggests a Strong momentum during a Trend
- Type D - Large Body (50-50 ratio), suggests a Noise during a Trend
