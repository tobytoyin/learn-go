RAID 0 disk configuration is an approach to fragment the data across multiple disks. This allows processing (read/ write operations) to be executed on multiple distributed disks in parallel, providing a higher performance than using a single disks.

## Computational Distribution

Although RAID 0 utilises multiple disks, the effect is sorely to allow Node to handle more I/O and computation by distributing disks. This is differ from using [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-33-82100#Replication|Disk for Replication]] to enhance storage fault tolerance.
