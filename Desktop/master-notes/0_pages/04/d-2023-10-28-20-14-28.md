## IAM DB Authentication

As RDS is a SaaS which AWS manages on hosting the database software in the cloud, by default access management & authentication is handled based on databases' own implementation (e.g., database's username & passwords).

*IAM DB Authentication* provides a simplified approach to allow other AWS services to access RDS database as  an "AWS managed resources". 
- by default RDS database accesses treats AWS resources as common clients, which requires database credentials (`user`, `password`) for its connection
- IAM DB Auth enabled RDS wraps the database with [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-02-40-59800|AWS IAM]], allowing AWS resources to use IAM session token to connect to RDS passwordless
