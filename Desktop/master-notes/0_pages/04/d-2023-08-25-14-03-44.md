When Subnets (or resources inside the subnets) need to have network accesses outsides of its VPC boundary. This requires a "**subnet's level internet gateway**". 

*NAT Gateway* is a *Network Address Translation* (NAT) service is a way which allows [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630#^42bb5a|VPC's subnets]] to connect external networks by masking its private IPv4 address:
- changing to another "translated" IP address in outbound traffics
- changing to the VPC's source IP address for response's inbound traffics

---
## Scenarios

This mainly uses as a **masked one-way connections** (outbound traffics from subnets) to external networks destination, while translated the response's inbound traffics back its original VPC's network gateway. This is commonly used for:

- *Masked System* - allows private subnets to have an network "backdoor" to connect to external internet, while keep it hidden from external server
- *Network Bounded System* - two different systems can maintain network connections via NAT Gateways, without unnecessary public internet exposures, e.g., "AWS-to-AWS", or "AWS-to-onprem" networks

---
## Public Outbound Traffics

*public outbound traffics* from NAT Gateway → Network Gateway → internet. 

The purpose of this compare to directly having a public subnet connecting to a internet gateway, is to **masked the public IP address of the Public subnet**, i.e., using the NAT gateway to "translated" into another IP address when requesting outbound traffics.

## Private Outbound Traffics

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230829144640.png]]

*Private NAT traffics* don't rely on Internet Gateway if we don't need public internet exposures. This relies on using [[Transit Gateway]] to: 
- connect to other VPC for traffics (this would be better with [[d-2023-08-29-14-31-49|AWS PrivateLink]])
- connect VPC to another on-premises network.
