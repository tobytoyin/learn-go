## Block Storage

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230708213148.png]]

In AWS, *Elastic Block Storage* ([[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-09-18-41-54|EBS]]) is a managed *Block Storage System* that stores data using raw Bytes, which provides the lowest-level of storage unit and manipulation in the Cloud environment. 

Storage splits storing data into bytes and stores them into different *block* sections of a system. For example: 
- writing a file - New Files are converts into sequence of Bytes, then store section of the sequences (*sharding*) into some blocks of a Block Storage System
- updating a file - Updated Files only update the "sections that are modified". Block Sections that are storing the Bytes that are modified are rewritten, while other Sections remain untouched. 

### Suitable For
Block Storage is suitable for: 
- *Write Many, Read Many* - IO intensive storage. This often includes system-level files that make lots of small changes (e.g., adding a few lines to system file)
- Low Latency Access - performance is important and provides low level Bytes size optimisation for developers/ systems 
- Machine level storages - i.e., storages for EC2 instances

## Object Storage

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230708214607.png]]

*Object Storage System* stores data as objects, i.e., a single file equates to a single object. Objects stored are not in hierarchical form and based on Prefix Key that allows the system to quickly scan related "files" in linear (see [[0_pages/54/d-2023-11-15-12-47-01|Object Storage]]). This is provided as [[0_pages/01/2023-08-26-12-30-04-74400|AWS S3]].

Object Storage uses full rewrites in either creating or updating files: 
- writing a file - New File converts into a sequence of Bytes, Object Storage System allocates Block Sections for the "object" to write into 
- updating a file - Updated File converts into sequence of Bytes, Object Storage System rewrites the entire allocated Block Sections file the new "object". (Or allocate new Blocks if there are versioning to the object)

### Suitable For 
- Archive & Backups - Large amount of files that don't often need to be extracted for, or as Backups & Snapshots of cloud applications
- *Write Once, Read Many* (WORM) - static files that has low input rate but expects high frequency retrievals
- System Generated Files - system that can generate consistent prefixes to allow quick file scans and simple queries to retrieve files

## File Storage System

File System stores files into hierarchical form and use directories to group and retrieve all relevant files. This is equivalent to File Explorer attached in local computer systems but remotely exists in multiple AZs. The common options:

- Elastic File System (*EFS*) - AWS managed file system for most use cases
- *FSx for Windows File Server* - Windows file system supports Microsofts AD
- *FSx for Lustre* - high performance file system for parallel processing

### Suitable For
- Application Level Files - formatted files that application can access through set of directories
- Shared Access - files that needs to be shared among users or AWS resources
- Batch Access - files that often needs to access by batch via pointing to a directory that stores all related files
