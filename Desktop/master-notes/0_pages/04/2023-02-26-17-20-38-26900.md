# PySpark - Mapping Dictionary 

## Mapping Values

It is quite common for an ETL process to map some values of a column to another value based on a Python `dict`. 

In Pandas, this can be written simply by using `replace()`:

However to do this in Spark. It is not that straight forward. This can be done using RDD/ UDF operation but they are usually inefficient in PySpark.

## Solution 

This can be done in this way. For the reason why, see below sections.

## `create_map`

`create_map` in PySpark creates a MapType column by creating a map object using one column as key another as value, i.e., `{col1 -> col2}`.

## Using `create_map` to map `dict`

### 1. Plan 

In order to allow Spark to do this kind of mapping, we need to ensure that a mapping `dict` (as a MapType object) is available row-wise. So that each Row can have access to the mapping object independently. 
We need to convert a `dict` key-value into multiple single-value columns, so that we can use `create_map`. Specifically: 

```python
index_map = {'A': 1, 'B': 2}

# becomes a dataframe with columns that looks like: 
df.select(
	F.lit('A'), F.lit(1), 
	F.lit('B'), F.lit(2), 
)
```

### 2. Flattening `dict` to key-value `list`

First we need to convert a `dict` into a key-value `list`, i.e.,

### 3. Create the Map column

Then we can use loop to create column:

### 4. Access Key by Column Value
Then we can use "key" column to access the Key of the "Map" column:
