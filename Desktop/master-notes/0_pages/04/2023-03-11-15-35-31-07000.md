# Hive Data Organisation 


Hive utilises [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]] and add 4 additional components to store the data: Database, Tables, Partitions, and Buckets. This allows Hive to turn HDFS's raw data files into a common relational database objects.  ^ff23ac

## Database

Databases mainly serves as a catalog of namespaces of different tables. This is commonly being used to organise different tables in different logical groups. 

It is particular useful to split different data into different databases when the share the same architectures and names.

> [!example]-
> 💭 Different clients would contain the same set of tables when they are coming from the same services provides. Similarly different departments might contain tables with the same names. 
> For example, different departments would contain the same “expenses” table and a database can be used to identify which department’s expense it is.

## Tables

Tables represents the same concepts of “files” storing in [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]] or outside of Hive system (called *External Table*). Data are query against Tables.

![[3_hidden/_images/tables-20221203211943.png]] ^0320d3

Tables follows HDFS storage approach: the data in the table are essentially split and stored across different data nodes in a cluster. When the required data is queried from a table, they are then retrieved from the data nodes based on the metadata stored inside a [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-22-07-17400|Name Node]].

> [!note]- Tables & Datasources
> Data stores in Hive and HDFS are removed when a Table is removed. 
> While external data sources’ data would still retain when a Table is removed. This is because the removal only concerns the metadata of the table regarding the location of the files. This approach is similar to Athena-S3 [[📍Athena Data Sources](/Athena-Data-Sources-af857c5ed8094fb7a0b7102053138650)].

## Data Storages

Hive Tables is in fact an query interface to the actual data stores in a distributed system. The actual data are stored in different Data Nodes under HDFS and Hive provided two approaches for engineers to organise the "data fragment" for [[0_pages/02/2023-10-10-23-59-37-82500|different performance purposes]].

> [!example]- Partitions
A *[[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|partition]]* represents the “directories” of the file storing the Table. Each “directory” is generated based on the unique values of a _partitioning column_.
Using Partitions is beneficial to improve I/O efficiency as this reduce computation overheads by pre-filtering only the data that is required.

> [!example]- Buckets
> Buckets are similar to Partitions but Buckets aim to break down a table into similar fragments with equal sizes and avoid creating partitions that are too fragmented or too dense ([[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600|hotspots]] issue).
> A Bucketing strategy would still based on the unique values in a partitioning column but it is not entirely constrained in creating “directories” from it.
