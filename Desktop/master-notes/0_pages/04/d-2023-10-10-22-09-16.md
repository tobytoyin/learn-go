Not to be confused with [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-06-12-53-13|NLB]], [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-06-12-53-13|ALB]] main purpose is to **route traffics to the "right place"**. This can be thought as a API gateway to handle the routing part to the correct endpoint. E.g., direct the right request traffics by URL to the right Lambda's API endpoint. In contrast **NLB aims to route traffics to multiple servers "evenly"**.

## ALB Fronting NLB 

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-16-21-46#^alb-nlb-fronting]]

By using ALB alone cannot improve performance when traffics volumes is high. This requires an additional NLB attach to the ALB to distribute traffics among the Target Groups' servers.
