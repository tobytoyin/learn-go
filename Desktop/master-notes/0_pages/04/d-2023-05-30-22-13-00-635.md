An *API Gateway* is the entry point when clients application is communicating with backend services (i.e., API requests). 

Without API Gateway, clients need to have a lots of complicated coupling and unstructured protocols when communicating with different Backend services. 

An API Gateway aims to abstract away this coupling and make communicating with Backend services from the client-side more simple, functionally purposed, and structured (**eqv orchestrating different Services through the Gateway**).


> [!example]
> When making a request like `api-function/param=A/param=B`, this goes through the API gateway and orchestrate different underlying functionalities in order complete the request for a particular function.

## Common Functionalities

As an orchestration layer to different micro-services, an API Gateway commonly handle different functions to ensure the API services is handling the request properly.

## Common Steps to Request Handling

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230530225848.png|500]]

An API Gateway generally go through some steps to handle requests: 
1. parameter validation - to check if the requested API and parameters are valid
2. allow/ deny list checking
	- to check if the requests service can be accessed or not (public accessible)
	- to check if the requests is coming from allow/ deny list of IP addresses
3. authentication 
	- to check if the request's identity has the right permission to access the services, e.g., tokens, identity, privileges, etc.
4. Rate Limit (optional)
	- to check if the identity has exceed the rate limit
	- usage/ rates to apply billing 
5. Dynamic Routing & Service Discovery
	- communicate/ orchestration of different services to complete a single functionality (API request)
