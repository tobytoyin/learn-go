# GraphQL

- based on a **single API endpoint to handle request** (vs REST using multiple parameterised endpoints)
- based on **declarative data fetching** - API "automatically" responses all the objects based on my inputs

---
## Vs REST

When composing a single data object in REST, this usually involves multiple steps: 
- client access multiple REST endpoints to get partial of data  → **excess network traffics**
- await for all the data from all endpoints to be completed → **difficult to develop**
- transform and construct the final data to serve → **retrieve lots of unused fields**

In GraphQL, this steps are simplified: 
- client access a single endpoint
- await for data retrieval is hidden in GraphQL
- minimal transform as required fields are declared in query

## GraphQL Schemas

GraphQL based on statically typed system as *Schema* to defines the relationship between Objects and Endpoints. 


> [!Tip]- Schema vs Backend
> GraphQL Schema itself only describe what different Objects, Queries should look like (eqv blueprints of API). The underlying logics of implementing it relies on different GraphQL Clients


The most basic type of Schema is [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-19-16-10-50|Object Type]], which represents the structure of the data object on fields and its relationship with other Objects

- [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-19-16-17-11|Query Type]] - typed the endpoint on how to fetch data
- [[0_pages/02/d-2023-10-19-16-34-31|Mutation Type]] - typed the endpoint on how to write data
- [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-18-23-13-35|Subscription Type]] - typed the endpoint on how to fetch pub-sub data

## Additional Features

- [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-19-22-05-30|Fragments]] - act as a Fields unpacks for Objects & Query
- [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-19-23-08-44|Meta Field]] - returns the Type Name of the Object Type
- [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-19-22-17-22|Aliases]] - useful to make multiple Queries that return results mapped by a key
- [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-19-22-30-17|Advance Type]] - provides some commonly Types that OOP typing systems use
