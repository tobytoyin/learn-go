An *Internet Gateway* provides a gateway to allow [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630|VPC]] to create **inbound/ outbound traffics to the public Internet**. 

By default, Internet Gateway accepts two way traffics (inbound + outbound). An *egress-only gateway* creates an network rule to allow only outbound traffics to the Internet (e.g., posting requests).
