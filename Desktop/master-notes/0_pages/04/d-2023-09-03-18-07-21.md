*SQS DeadLetters Queue* is a mechanism to handle failure in a [[AWS SQS]]. This kind of SQS provides two different storages: 
- SQS storage - storing the received and non-completed messages
- SQS DeadLetters Storage - storing messages that fail to deliver multiple times

This allows "identifiable messages" to be stored in a DeadLetter message queue as a storage for data that failed to be consumed by the Subscriber system

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-03-18-09#^deadletter]]

The setup is as follow: 
- **create an "ID field"** and making each messages as identifiable, i.e., when the same ID message are received in SQS multiple times, it would be deemed as "failed to deliver"
- setup number of retries, i.e, how many times can the same ID be received
- point the normal SQS to another "DeadLetter queue", allowing SQS to send messages that can't be consumed into the DeadLetter queue
