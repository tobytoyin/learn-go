*VPC Endpoint* is a common connection protocol for which a consumer VPC can access AWS resources through a private network. This allows all kinds of network connections within AWS resources being done entirely inside AWS network infrastructure without using public Internet. 

VPC Endpoint allows to kind of private connections: 
- Gateway endpoints - private connection to AWS managed resources
- Interface endpoints - private connections to other VPC resources

*Gateway Endpoints* can be registered to an existing VPC network, allowing service request to AWS resources being done within AWS's network infrastructure instead of going through the Internet. 

In other words, instead of sending API requests to AWS resources via the Internet, the API requests are made via AWS own network.

*Interface Endpoints* can be registered to an existing VPC network, allow making network request (with [[wip/d-2023-08-29-14-31-49|AWS PrivateLink]]) to some other AWS resources and VPC resources in the same account or provided by other AWS accounts. 

In other words, Interface Endpoints is mainly used to communicate with other VPC or as a way to use SaaS provided by other AWS accounts hosted in VPC.
