## Scenario

In a Python project, we might have some optional features using other dependencies that we don't want to include into the "core" version of our application. 

For example, consider we have a project that have two groups:
- `my_app[core]` - contains all libraries, `lib-a`, `lib-b`, `lib-c`
- `my_app[extra]` - contains all libraries in `core` plus `lib-extra`

## Setting Dependency Group

When installing packages through [[0_pages/02/2023-03-20-12-21-40-09600|Poetry]], we can specify which "dependency group" we want to add a package into, or which group the Python package should be building from. 

```shell
# add module to a specific group
poetry add --group <dep_group> ...

# add into pyproject.toml as 
# [tool.poetry.group.<dep_group>.dependencies]
# module = ...
# ...
```

We can also make the dependency group as optional, as to indicate as dependencies for optional features in the package. This requires updating the TOML: 

```toml
...
[tool.poetry.group.<dep_group>]
optional = true

[tool.poetry.group.<dep_group>.dependencies]
module = "..."

...
```

## Installing Dependency Group

To install a particular dependency group (core source code + extra dependencies):

```shell
poetry install with <dep_group>

# similar to myproject[dep_group]
```
