# Deprecated Update

This note is outdated and replaced by [[0_pages/04/d-2023-08-23-18-58-03|MERGE Cypher]]

## üîë Keywords

To create a new Node or new Relationship, we can use:

-   `MERGE` ensure unique object is created (same unique ID property & same Label/ Type)
-   `CREATE` creates new object without deduplication

The key difference is that `MERGE` would conduct a patterns search before `CREATE`, while `CREATE` wouldn‚Äôt check for existing patterns.

---
## ‚ûï Create Node

To create a new Node, we need to specify the Node type and the property of unique ID.

---
## ‚ûï Create Relationship

To create a new Relationship, we need to specify both the head and tail Node. Additionally, we can also specify properties in a Relationship that is unique to the Node-to-Node context.

There are two scenarios in creating a new Relationship:

-   existing Nodes - use `MATCH` pattern to find the Nodes and assign as variables
-   new Nodes - use `MERGE` to create new Nodes and assign as variables

## ‚è´ UPSERT Properties

-   `SET` - used to in both updating and creating new Property of both Node and Relationship.
-   `REMOVE` - used to remove existing Property if available

---
## üîÄ Conditional UPSERT Properties

In many situation, we would need populate different properties at creation and at update. For example, to log properties like ‚Äúcreation time‚Äù and ‚Äúupdate time‚Äù. Without having to write complicate logics to check, Cypher can use _Merge Processing_ to create properties in condition to different processing scenarios:

-   `ON CREATE ...` - executes the logics when `MERGE` would create new Graph‚Äôs component
-   `ON MATCH ...` - executes the logics when `MERGE` found an existing Graph‚Äôs component

---
## ‚ùå Deleting Graph Components

Cypher makes Components deletion safe. This means when executing deletion, it ensures:

-   Edge can be deleted directly with `DELETE`, i.e., disconnecting the relationship
-   Orphan Node with no connected relationship can also be `DELETE` directly
-   Nodes that are connected with other Nodes are first `DETACH` (become orphan) then `DELETE`
