## Create Node with Merge

`MERGE` is used for creating Node in Neo4J. `MERGE` a node implicitly perform two steps: 
1. `MATCH` for the same node with the given primary key(s)
2. `CREATE` for a new node if the `MATCH` returns nothing

When using `MERGE` we have to specify both the node's Label and its primary key(s). For example, to create a new `Person` node, which the data model uses `name` as primary key: 

```cypher
MERGE (p: Person {name: "primary key"})
```

The second this is being run, it wouldn't take effect because a node with the same Label and primary key already exists.

## Updating Node with Merge

`MERGE` can also be used for updating node's existing data: 

```cypher
// updating specific properties & Label
MERGE (p: Person {name: "primary key"})
SET p.key1 = "some value"
SET p:newLabel // this add a new label, remove oldLabel if req
```

or updating the entire node's data (including its primary key): 

```cypher
// replacing the entire property with the new data
MERGE (p: Person {name: "primary key"})
SET p={name:"new primary key", key1: "some value"}
```

## Creating New Relationships with Existing Nodes

`MERGE` can be used to create new relationships with existing nodes. To create a new relationship, it needs to specify: 
- the Edge Label - `[r: Label]`
- (optional) the Edge properties - `[r: Label {...}]`

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person {name: "some name"})
MATCH (m:Movie {title: "some title"})
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN {key1: "some value"}]->(m)
```

## Creating New Relationships with New Nodes

In some scenario, new edges may not be related to any existing nodes in the database. For instances:

- the operation for creating the related Node hasn't taken place yet
- a potential unknown relational entities (common in [[wip/graph/Knowledge Graph|Knowledge Graph]])

Hence we might need to create new nodes & new edges at the same time:

```cypher
MERGE (p:Person {name: "some name"})
MERGE (m:Movie {title: "some title"})  // replace MATCH wit MERGE
MERGE (p)-[r:ACTED_IN {key1: "some value"}]->(m)
```
