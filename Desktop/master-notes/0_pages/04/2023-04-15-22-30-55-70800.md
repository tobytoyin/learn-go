## Functions as Procedural Tasks

Instead of using traditional DAG and Task objects to handle workflow. *Taskflow API* allows more expressive and Pythonic ways to **compose procedural functions**. Considering a very simple workflow: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230415225726.png]]

```python
# basic taskflow API skeleton
@dag(...)
def workflow():

	# define tasks functions
	@task:
	def task1():
		...

	@task:
	def task2(task1_result: dict):
		...

	# define workflow structure as functional calls
	task1_result = task1()
	task2_result = task2(task1_result)

# call main worflow
workflow()
```


> [!Tip] 
> This approach is just like using generic Python to compose procedural logics by calling/ chaining multiple functions

## Benefits


### Better Results Downstream

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230415225920.png]]

With classical approach, downstream Tasks' outputs rely on [[2023-04-23-19-27-27-18800|XCOM]] to query output from downstream Tasks to upstream Tasks. Using Taskflow decorated functions, **upstream outputs can downstream directly to the next Task**. This makes it easier to understand the logics from the code reviewing perspective. 

### Reusable Functions

Every DAG and Tasks are now functions. This makes it easier to reuse the same functional DAG and Tasks by passing different parameters based on different workflow requirements ([[0_pages/01/2023-04-15-23-06-33-58000|examples]]) and pass on the configuration responsibilities to other users/ developers.
