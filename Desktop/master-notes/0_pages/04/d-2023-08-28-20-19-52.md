*Elastic Beanstalk* is a simplified way to deploy application in AWS through a managed resources creation & deployment. This is a Platform as a Service (PasS). 

- Application stacks are structured in a through a file structure
- Elastic Beanstalk provides *templated AWS platforms* which managed the creation and deployment of all the required AWS resources that is needed when creating an online platform
- instead of using a robust method (e.g., [[CloudFormation]]) to define all the AWS resources and its architecture, Elastic Beanstalk focuses on code & business logics
