An *Repository Pattern* is an architectural method that aims to: 
- decouple [[0_pages/03/2023-03-13-21-51-27-93200|Domain Model]] from the implementation of the Storage Layer
- Domain Model uses an interface to interact with databases
- enable Domain Layer's system testings without connecting to live databases
- as a "[[#Repository Abstraction|connector]]" between Domain Layer to different Storage technologies

## Problem with Framework Coupling

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230313220706.png]]

When a Domain Layer is coupled with Storage Layer, the codes within Domain Layer is often coupled and written specifically for a particular language (e.g., writing a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-11-15-33-03-38700|Value Object]] using specific ORM models). 

This makes it **difficult for technology migration and often requires a full rework** by reworking the code base from one framework to another. For example, when a Domain Model changes the storage from SQL to NoSQL, lots of efforts are required to rebuild the Domain's Layer (e.g., ways to commit transaction; ways to lookup records' ID, etc...)

## Repository Abstraction

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230313221201.png|500]]

The main purpose of using an *repository layer* is to invert the dependency, i.e., Domain Layer not being dependent on different Storage's framework. An **Repository Layer becomes an abstraction layer** that perform (mostly) any: 
- **objects' transformation** from Domain Layer into appropriate Records for different databases (Rows/ Documents/ others...)
- **objects "adder" and "getter"** that can connect to different databases and conduct I/O 

By decoupling the Storage Layer's dependency, migration to new technologies only require new implementation instead of full rework. 

> [!NOTE]- How does Domain Layer interact with Storage then?
> It doesn't "directly". These abstract methods simply extract the details of "how to interact with a database" into the Repository Layer. Domain Layer simply knows that using those abstract methods, it can reliably read/ write data to the database.

## Use Cases Examples

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230313221841.png|500]]

The most simple use case for an Repository Layer is to have 3 abstract methods for the Domain Layer to interact with:
- `get` - domain model to get records from some storage
- `add` - domain to add records from some storage
- `transform` - to transform records from Domain Layer's object to storage's inputs

For example, we can have a "Django Repository" that is using Django ORM that connects to a SQL database: 
- write process - `transform` Domain Objects into Rows, then `add` into SQL
- read process - `get` Rows from SQL, then `transform` into Domain Objects
- both process focuses only on the injection of domain layer's objects into another layer

## Testing with Repository Pattern

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230313223403.png|500]]

The major challenge of testing while developing a Domain Layer is how to **test the system without connecting to a live database**. Repository Layer makes the switching of different storages easy and test friendly: 
- development tests - use the repository to store records in-memory/ connect to a local DB server
- integration tests - use a non-prod repository to connect to non-prod DB
- production - use a prod repository to connect to prod DB
