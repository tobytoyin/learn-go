# Using Pointers in Function

The essential is that **[[0_pages/02/2023-04-10-16-06-41-06100|Pointer]] interact only with Addresses** and what a pointer function is essentially accepting arguments that is a "memory address type" rather than an actual variable:

```go
func workOnPointer(xPtr *int) {
	// using a ptr addres to access the value
	x = *xPtr 
	
	// do something on `x`
}

// using a Pointer func
x := 100  
workOnPointer(&x)  // passing the Address (&) of x

```

1. the functional signature - `func(&ptrAdddress)` passes the variable's Pointer address into the scope of the function
2. within the scope of the function, values are accessed (`*`) from the address

## Function without Pointers

Functions in Go by default copy the values of the inputs into a variables in the functional scope;
- original variable `x` has one address 
- a copy of the original variable inside the functional scope (`x_`) has one address 
- function references to the local copy `x_` and work on it

	This often assumes that variables pass to a function should be immutable and new state should always be exchanged into a new variable.

## Function with Pointers

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230627213554.png]]

Function that uses Pointers enforces the function to reference the variable based on its address rather than creating another copy of it locally: 
- original variable `x` has one address
- address (`xPtr := &x`) is passed to the function
- values are accessed from pointer using `*xPtr`
