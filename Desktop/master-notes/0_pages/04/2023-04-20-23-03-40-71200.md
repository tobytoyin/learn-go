## Heaps, Objects, and Garbage Collections

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230422211904.png]]^heap-basics

*Heap Memory* is the **main memory for storing Java Objects**:
1. Java objects that are created during a JVM runtime are stored in Heap
2. Heap can store as many objects as long as it has free spaces
3. Memories (*Heap Size*) are limited; when there are no more free spaces in Heap, objects are removed from Heap to [[0_pages/01/2023-04-22-21-24-06-50700|Off Heap]] through *[[#Garbage Collections]]* process (aka GC)

> Heap Memories are shared within the same JVM Context. This indicates that when there are multiple Threads/ Applications running under the same Context, all the objects are stored in the same Heap and consumes a single Heap Size. This behaviour is sometime warned as "*not thread safe*" because multiple threads can interact with the shared memory.

## Heap Regions

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230423132732.png|500]]^heap

Heap Memory are separated into two regions: 
- *Young Heap* - short-lived/ recently created objects, They are intended for temporary and quick access to objects to handle immediate tasks
- *Old Heap* - cached objects and objects that survive for a long time in JVM app lifecycle; it is also the final Heap destination for GC objects

Different stages of Heap depends on how long it lives in a JVM app lifecycle, i.e., how many times it avoids from being removed from Heap by GC. This is referred as "*Survival and Promotion*".

## Minor Garbage Collections 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230423133601.png|500]]

The main purpose of a *minor Garbage Collections* is to reorganise objects in JVM for efficient accesses by **move younger regions' objects to older regions**. This allows sufficient space in Young Heaps to handle immediate tasks. There are two scenarios a minor GC take place: 

- **any Young Heap region is full** - all the objects in a particular region are moved to an "older" Heap region. e.g., Eden moves to Survivor 1; Survivor 2 moves to Old
- **any objects exceed certain lifetime** - any Young Heap objects lived sufficiently long in JVM are dump into an "older" Heap region

## Full Garbage Collections

As Old Heap is the final destination of GC objects, it would eventually filled up the region. When this happens, minor GC could no longer take place and would start a *full Garbage Collection*.

It mainly involves two process to reclaim spaces in all Heap regions: 
- **collect all unused objects** - GC would collect all the unused objects in the entire Heap and remove them from Heap to the *Off-Heap's Garbage Collector*
- **refill younger Heap Regions** - "older" regions objects are moved back to "younger" regions, as to fill-up unused space in younger Heap regions. (By reclaiming more spaces in older regions, this allows more minor GC happens before another full GC)
