# Async Download Walkthrough 


This video briefly talks about [[0_pages/03/d-2023-06-30-22-06-11|Asynchronous]] download and it is useful to help understand the workflow of a async programme.

## Step 1

The first step of Async download is that the Main Thread (`main`) would receive a list of download links and append them into a Queue.

## Step 2

The Download Thread (i.e., an event while loop) would initialised by dequeuing the list of URL and start downloading requests for each URL at the background.  
Each download process would be running in a `Downloader` and their progress status would be stored inside a Event State Queue.

## Step 3

The event loop would infinitely access the async `Downloader` to obtain the download status. This allows the event loop to know the progress and update the status in the Event State Queue.

## Step 4

Then the event loop would contain a logic to remove any "completed" item from the Event State Queue. This essentially removing items from the Download Thread to keep track of.  
This process continues until there are no more items in the Event State Queue (either all download are completed or catch timeout). Then the event loop would end and complete the async download.
