A *Network* in the Internet represents the **boundary of an entity that uses to communicate with each others**. 

A Network comes with a *network gateway*, this **controls what traffics can go in and go out within a network**, i.e., who and whom a network can communicate with.

This abstraction is similar to how we send "letters" in the real world: 
- Real World → Internet - this is where letters sending (internet traffics) happen
- *Network* represents the entity in the Internet and each contains *IP Address(es)*

Whenever letter sending happens → *Internet Traffics* and this requires the use of *IP Addresses*: 
	- Sender → *Inbound Traffics*; it's address is the *Inbound IP Address* wrt to our Network
	- the process of handling letters sending/ receiving → *Network Protocols*, e.g., HTTPs, through a *Network Gateway* in each Network
	- A network can also send things out → *Outbound Traffics*; it needs to have an *Outbound IP Address* (or the same Network IP) to communicate with others
