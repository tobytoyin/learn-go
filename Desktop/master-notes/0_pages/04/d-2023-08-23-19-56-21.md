## Scenario

To create/ update nodes that are related to a Placeholder Node(s), it needs perform a single transaction that aims to create *one-to-many relationships* for a Node.

We need to execute the following operations in one [[0_pages/03/d-2023-08-25-13-48-49|Unit of Work]]: 
- [[#Detach All Relationship]] as to update/ create a new set of edges  
- [[#Create one-to-many relationships]] create new nodes  & new edges

---
## Detach All Existing Relationships

Assuming we want to have a full update on all the relationships, i.e., removing + adding new relationship for an Node. The transaction needs to first delete all the existing edges first.

```sql
MATCH (n {pk: "root_primary_key"})-[r:LINK]->() DELETE r
```

we can `idProps` or `id()` to bound a Node and then detach all of its existing relationship. This assumes our data (usually documents contain a full set of relationship metadata).

## Create one-to-many relationships

Then we can use a for loop to [[0_pages/04/d-2023-08-23-18-58-03#Creating New Relationships with New Nodes|MERGE]] multiple Nodes along with their own set of edge Label and edge properties:

```cypher
MATCH (n {pk: "root_primary_key"})

// basically a for loop to pair merge new nodes & edge
MERGE (target1 {pk: "primary_key_1"})
MERGE (n)-[:edgeLabel {...}]->(target1)

MERGE (target2 {pk: "primary_key_2"})
MERGE (n)-[:edgeLabel {...}]->(target2)

MERGE (target3 {pk: "primary_key_3"})
MERGE (n)-[:edgeLabel {...}]->(target3)
```
