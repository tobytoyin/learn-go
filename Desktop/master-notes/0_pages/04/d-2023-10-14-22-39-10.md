When containers can be deployed together in a [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700#üíä Pod|Pod]], lots of the components within in single large application can be decoupled and containerised into a single application. 

There are several common design patterns for containers work together in a Pod: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231015234759.png]]

- *SideCar* - several containers are used to support the main `App` Container that is hosting the main application logics. E.g., an `App` container is supported by `Cache` and `DB` containers to provide data volume for the `App`
- *[[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-15-23-02-26|Ambassador]]* - proxy container is responsible for proxy and redirecting out-going traffics to the correct external endpoints 
- *Adapter* - one container is responsible to be an [[d-2023-09-18-22-13-28|adapter]] by modifying the inputs into the suitable format for `Client` application's container that executes the logics

## InitContainers

When containers are coupled based on a "Leader", a Pod might need to prioritise in build up those "Leaders" before other "Workers" containers can be created. This build up of Leaders can be defined using `initContainers`, which are **containers build prior** to other `containers`.
