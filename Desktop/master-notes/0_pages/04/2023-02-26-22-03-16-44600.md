# Scaling in Snowflake 


When dealing with cluster of compute resources, we often need to think about how to [[d-2023-08-01-12-18-52|scale]] them up to handle different workloads. 

In Snowflake, [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-04-27-31600#^4d8f21|virtual warehouses]] provides two ways to perform scaling.

## ↕️ Vertical Scaling (Up/ Down)

*Scaling up/ down* a virtual warehouse (Cluster) means whether we need more computation resources (Nodes) or not. In Snowflake, this means by converting the size of a cluster (Up - XS to M, Down - XL to M).  

When handling a large/ complex query, we might need more machines (Nodes) to help for computation. In this case, we can just scaling up more resources within the same virtual warehouse, so that it can help to compute more data without all queued up.

## ↔️ Horizontal Scaling (Out/ In)

When the performance is throttled by increasing amount of Clients accessing the data from virtual warehouse, this would increasing overload the cluster's network and reduce response time. Scaling up the cluster won't help because the bottleneck is at the the virtual warehouse's own network capacity. 

*Scaling Out/ In* means to increase additional "system-wise" resources by combining/ removing new Warehouses (i.e., combine/ remove clusters). This requires a scaling out into multi-clusters virtual warehouses. This transfers some clients to access another cluster's network and read from another database replica.
