To setup a non-Docker Desktop [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300|Kubernetes]], it needs several additional softwares and setup to making it work: 

- `brew` - MacOS way to install CLI softwares
- `podman` - a virtual machine to run containers on MacOS
- `minikube` - to setup K8s cluster locally

> [!tip]- Why might want to avoid Docker Desktop
> There are some reason why we might want to avoid using Docker Desktop, which provides containers and Kubernetes out of the box: 
> - not suitable for enterprise development environment
> - Kubernetes deprecating supports to Docker engine
> - Podman allows containers at non-root level

## 1. Install Podman and Setup VM

Podman is an alternative to Docker, which is under a open source license.

```bash
# install podman
brew install podman

# setup a virtual machine with 2 CPUs 
podman machine init --cpus 2

# start a virtual machine 
podman machine start 

# to turn it off later 
podman machine stop
```

## 2. Install MiniKube and Setup Cluster

A K8s cluster can be started with `minikube`, which is a light weight cluster. 

```bash
# install minikube
brew install minikube

# config cluster to run on non-root (not sudo)
minikube config set rootless true

# start cluster through podman
minikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=containerd 

# check if cluster is running and the control panel address
kubectl cluster-info
```

There are more configuration like setting the `kubectl version`. See more in [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/config/)
