*Route Table* in [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630|VPC]] controls the *network traffics flows* of Subnets within a VPC. For example, this controls: 
- how subnets' networks should be exposed
- whether subnets can expose to the public internet
- whether subnets can expose to other subnets
- how subnets/ gateways can flow in/ out in the VPC

Each Route Table configures the following: 
- *Destination* - the VPC/ Subnet IP range that allow traffics
- *Target* - the Gateway that traffics are coming from

## Main Route Table

In each subnet, it is default attached to a *Main Route Table* that allow local traffics to all Subnets within the VPC. This assumes that all the Subnets can communicate to other Subnets but not expose to the public Internet. This Main Route Table can be replaced by other custom Route Tables.

## Public Facing Route Table

To configure other network traffics (e.g., allowing public traffics), we need to create a *custom Route Table*. To allow public internet traffics flow into "public" subnets: 
- a custom Route Table is attached to the VPC's *Internet Gateway*
- expose all IP Range (0.0.0.0/0) to the Gateway as Destination
- attach the said Route Table to those "public" facing subnets

## Limited Traffics within VPC

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230604180857.png]]

Some application would limit certain Subnets to communicate to a specific subnet only (this coupling is called *Service*). Custom Route Tables can be defined to limit traffics among subnets, for example: 
- Both database's subnet and a driver's subnet IP are attached to one *Service Route Table*
- a separate service Route Table is attached to workers and driver's subnets that allow traffics between Workers and driver  ^b07bb4
- this limits traffics from workers to the database subnet (usually they allow for public traffics)
