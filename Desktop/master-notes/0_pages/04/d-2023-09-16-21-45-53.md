Both [[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-09-18-41-54|EBS]] and [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-14-04-20-60100|EFS]] are "disks level" storages that **needs to be attached** to some AWS compute resources (e.g., EC2 instance). The main difference is that: 
- EBS lives only within one AZ as in the compute instance, i.e., physically attached to a machine in a data centre
- EFS lives in multiple AZ, which operates as a remote file system for the machine

[[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-14-04-20-60100|S3]] differentiates as a global level object storages that don't need to be attached to a compute resources. S3 itself is a system and access using a "API request" model to transmit objects.
