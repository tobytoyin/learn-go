A *grok* filter in Logstash is responsible for a few things: 
- match and apply "grok expression" based on certain Field
- populate new Fields based on the grok expression

It follows the below structure, which indicates: 
- match and apply our `<pattern_match_stm>` on a some `%{<field>}`
- base on the grok expression, it extracts and populate new `<field>`

```ruby
grok {
	match => {
		"<field>" => "<pattern_match_stm>"
	}
}
```

## Build in Patterns

Logstash's Grok has some build-in pattern that can be used right away and can be extracted using `%{SYNTAX:field}`:
- `SYNTAX` - the pattern of the text we wish to match for
- `field` - the Field to populate for the matched pattern

For example, below is a log event composed of: 
- IP address with IP address pattern
- Request method with generic String value
- Request path with URI path pattern
- duration with generic numerical value

```txt
55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 0.043
```

We can use build-in pattern to match each part and assign them into named Fields: 

```ruby
grok {
	match => {
		"message" => "%{IP:ip} %{WORD:method} %{URIPATHPARAM:path} %{NUMBER:duration}"
	}
}
```

Indicating - using an existing `%{message}` Field, match the pattern and populates: 
- `ip` - matching an `IP` pattern
- `method` - matching any string (`WORD`) pattern
- etc...

## Generic Regex

As Grok expression is a subset of Regular Expression, any valid regex pattern can also be mixed with and used in the pattern match statement. The extraction operation can use Regex Capture Group `(?<field>...)`.

For example, the below log event contains Date that cannot be captured using build-in pattern: 

```txt
2020-01-01 [INFO]
```

We can mixed in Regex with capture group to match and populate the Field: 

```ruby
grok {
	match => {
		"message" => "(?<datepart>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}) \[%{WORD:level}\]"
	}
}
```

Indicating - using an existing `%{message}` Field, match the pattern and populates: 
- `datepart` - based on the defined regex capture group
- `level` - using the generic `WORD` pattern to extract
