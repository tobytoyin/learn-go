To allow any kind of network traffics goes into the VPC, this requires IP Address. When network traffics goes into VPC's Subnets, it is connecting via a *dynamic IP address* and these IP addresses are based an IP Range. This means that the network IP addresses to the Subnets will be different with different compute instances being launched.

AWS uses Classless Inter-Domain Routing (*CIDR*) notation to define the IP Range for each Subnet. This provides certain controls over: 

- the value range of IP addresses, e.g., `10.x.x.x`
- the fine grind range of IP to be assigned as Private/ Public Subnets
- the maximum amount of IP addresses, which determines how much network traffics could be handled at the same time

## IP Addressing

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231031231128.png]]

To provide a list of viable IP addresses a VPC can be used for network traffics, this relies on a hierarchical assignment of IP Range based on *CIDR Blocks*:

- *VPC CIDR Blocks* - defines a range of IP addresses a VPC can use, eqv to the range of IP addresses that all Subnets within the VPC can use
- *Subnet CIDR Blocks* - defines a sub-range of IP addresses a Subnet can use within the VPC

### Simplified Example

If a VPC CIDR defines four IP addresses (`10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.3`): 
- Subnet-1 CIDR could assign subset of those `10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.1`
- Subnet-2 CIDR could assign another subset of those `10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.3`

Because of the hierarchical nature of IP range assignment, some rules need to be followed: 
- Subnets' CIDR IP Ranges need to be covered by the VPC CIDR's IP Range
- Subnet CIDR IP Ranges cannot overlap with other Subnet CIDR's Ranges
