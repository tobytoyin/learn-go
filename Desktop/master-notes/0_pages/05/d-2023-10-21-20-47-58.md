## Pod's Volume

A *volume* in a Pod is a storage system that shares with all the Containers in the same Pod (aka *data sharing*). This exists in each Container as **an additional directory/ file to the extended the Containers' own filesystem**. 

The `volume` is generally sourced from the Node's storage resource on the same Node that is hosting the Pod. But in the K8s virtualised context, it is not part of the Pod's context.

There are several common Pod's volumes: 
- `hostPath` - mount the Node's volume and shares with all Pod's Containers
- `emptyDir` - type of [[wip/d-2023-10-22-20-40-41|ephemeral filesystem]] that has lifecycle as the Pod (removes when the Pod is removed) and mainly uses to move files among Containers

## Container's VolumeMount

A *volume mount* is an action that **links a Container's directory to an external storage**. This is specified by using `mountPath`, which indicates which Container's storage object should be linked and overrides by the external storage object (`/target:/destination`).

## Major Difference

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231022130538.png]]

- `volume` is the **storage resources** (aka [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-24-34-92400|kind]]) within the Pod 
- `volumeMount` is the **action of linking Container's data** to the `volume`  resources
