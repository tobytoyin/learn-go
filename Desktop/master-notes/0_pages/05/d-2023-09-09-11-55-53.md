Class Mixin has some common similarity with [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-25-46-85100|Decorator Pattern]] but has a different approach in terms of how to extend behaviours of a class.

## Mixin 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230909122213.png|500]]

*Mixin* class aims to **extend functionality/ attributes** of another class without the need to maintain the same object interface, e.g.: 
- adding a new `func` to `Class(Mixin)`
- adding a new `attrib` to `Class(Mixin)`

This aims to achieve *polymorphism* allowing other classes to be part of another class. In order word, the inheritance strategy is used to add new functionality without adding class dependencies.
