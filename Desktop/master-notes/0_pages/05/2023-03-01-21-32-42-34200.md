# Partitions Rebalancing 

The main object of *Partitions Rebalancing* is to: 
- change in number of partitions (scale up/ down)
- moving data from one partition to another (aka *repartitioning*)

## Why Rebalancing is needed?

When a system evolves overall time, there are some common scenarios we might need to redistribute the data:
- *Relief Hardwares* - some Nodes/ partition becomes [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600|overloaded]] and need to redistribute the data to relief the hardware
- *New Hardwares* - new storage are available and need to redistribute some data to there

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Avoid/ be Caution of

Deciding how to do rebalancing is not a simple task because we want to avoid: 
- *unnecessary moves* - moving data is **expensive in both network & I/O**, we want to avoid moving data if things are doing alright
- *resources not utilised* - redistributing data that are not accessed frequently/ high volume, would lead to low utilisation (e.g., low read/ low write) of partitions
- *full data scan* - avoid having to scan & sort all data again to update [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-41-40-19700|metastores]]
- *availability* - avoid affecting existing read/ writes operations while moving data
