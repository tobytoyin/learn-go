# 📓 The Mental Picture of AWS Access Management

Creating AWS CloudFormation resources usually involve lots of policies & resources definitions, this models aim to provide a higher-level picture on how users/ resources are connected and what needs to be created:

All of the actions in AWS are followed by: 
1. [[0_pages/01/d-2023-06-16-17-32-37-649|IAM Identities]] making "Action Requests" to a Service and Service executing them within the Resources
2. Resources can also assumed to another Identity by [[0_pages/02/d-2023-02-26-14-24-33|Assumed Roles]]
3. IAM Identities being the entity that initialise the Actions are "*Principal*"

Both IAM Identities and Resources are bounded by *Policy Statements*:
- IAM Identities/ Assumed Roles are bounded by [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-11-22-57-32|IAM Policy]]
- Resources are bounded by [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-11-22-57-32|Resource Policy]]
