# Structural Node Colouring 

### Objective
*Structural Node Colouring* is a "*Graph Hashing*" approach to understand the *similarity* of structure and connections among different graphs.

### Key Approach
This is done by converting Nodes' shortest paths into colour contrast to reflect structural similarity. Graphs that are more similar in structure has lower colour contrast; whereas more dissimilar in structure has a higher colour contrast.

## Similarity of Structure

As Graph is not a matrix (i.e., orders and structure can varies), traditional *similarity measures* (matrix distance) cannot tell how structurally similar two graphs are. 

Based on graphs *shortest paths* $d$ (graph's equivalent distance), Nodes can be [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-15-28-13200|hashed]] into colours. These *colour hashes* can show typologically (i.e., structurally) how similar two graphs can be based on the *contrast of colour*: 
- graphs with identical structure would generate the same colour hash
- equivalently graphs with similar structure (i.e., similar shortest paths value), would generate similar colour hash
- dissimilar structure would generate a very different colour hash

> When two graphs have the same structure, their coloured Nodes would always be the same. This indicates an "identical" similarity of two graphs.

> Let say we have 10 different colours to choose from: 
> - one of the shortest path $d_A$ in graph A is 5 : $5\%10 = 5$
> - another similar graph with shortest path $d_B$ being 5: $6\%10 = 6$
> - a dissimilar graph with shortest path $d_C$ being 1: $1\%10 = 1$
> - hashed colour for $A$ and $B$ would belong to a similar colour range (5-6); while $A$ and $C$ being dissimilar would have a higher contrast colour range

## Double Radius Nodes Labelling 

One example is *Double Radius Nodes Labelling*: 
1. in a graph, select two landmark nodes ($x$, $y$)
2. for each other nodes in a graph, compute the shortest path distances: 
	- $d_x$ - shortest path distance to node $x$
	- $d_y$ - shortest path distance to node $y$
3. create a colour hash based on the formula:
