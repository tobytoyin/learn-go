# Collaborative Filtering Main Ideas 

*Collaborative Filtering* is a Recommender Model that based on the combination of two kinds of similarities with respect to some "unknown attributes":
- users' similarity towards their preference to attributes
- items' similarity that share similar attributes

This is done by using models to ==learn these attributes as [[latent representations]] (embeddings)== and use them to make recommendations

## Collaborative Similarities

The "Collaborative" aspect of this Recommender System is that recommendations are not only "item-based" but also taken "user-based" similarity into consideration. 

This means an Recommender would be looking at a set of "*latent attributes*" and recommend items to users that are similar in: 

> [!Tip] Two Similarities for Recommendations
> *item-based similarity*: 
> "If he already like A, he would probably other items that are similar to A"
> 
> *user-based similarity*: 
> "If User B has a similar taste as User C, he probably likes what User C likes. "


### 1. Item-based Similarity

The 1st aspect of recommendation is by *item-based similarity*. This generates "recommendation scores" (aka *item matrix*) of each item based on how similar to the items a user already liked.  

> [!Example]- Example
> Using video games with a one attribute, e.g., how ''story-rich" a video game is.
> When a User generally gave higher rating to games that have a more "story-rich", a Recommender could recommend other games that have similar trait.

> (note: these attributes are commonly "learnt" by models instead of human defined)

### 2. User-based Similarity 
The 2nd aspect of recommendation is by *user-based similarity*. This generates another recommendation scores (aka *user matrix*) of each user based on how similar one user is to other users.

> [!Example]- Example
> We can represent Users based on their preference to different attributes (i.e, *user profiles*). These profiles contain information of Users' preference on video games' attributes.
>
> The below matrix shows that User A and User C are quite similar, i.e., both like their video games to be "humour" and "sports". This allows the Recommender to recommend games that User C likes to User A.

## The Recommendation

In above we see that, if an Recommender knows about the "item-based" and "user-based" similarities, then it can take these two perspectives to make recommendations. 

### Objective

The major objective of a Collaborative Filtering Recommender is to based on some actual user-item interaction data (aka *Feedback Matrix*) and then try to figure out these two matrices (users matrix & items matrix). 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230205223609.png]]

1. Data Gathering 
	- Feedback Matrix that records the actual interaction between users and items, e.g., user-items rating etc.
2. Decomposition 
	- User Matrix and Items Matrix are learnt from Feedback Matrix
3. Reconstruction 
	- trained User Matrix and Items Matrix then reconstruct another *Recommendation Matrix* that is closely approximate to the Feedback Matrix
4. Recommendation 
	- recommendations are made based on the reconstructed matrix

### Training Algorithms 

The main algorithms are models that can learn the *latent representations* (aka *embeddings*) of both Users and Items: 
- matrices decomposition - [[SVD]], [[Matrix Factorisation]]
- deep learning embedding -
