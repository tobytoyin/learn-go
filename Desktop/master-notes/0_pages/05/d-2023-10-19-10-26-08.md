## Resolver as API Handler

When GraphQL API handles a query, all the data fetching logics are completed through a Schema's Fields' *Resolver Function* . Every Resolver has the same [[0_pages/03/2023-03-20-12-19-29-31000|functional signature]]: 

> ResolverFunc = (node, info, ...arguments) ⇒ Objects

- `node` - the current Object Schema
- `info` - the Context within the current execution
- `arguments` - the arguments defined by the [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-19-16-17-11|Endpoint]]

The benefit of using an Resolver in developing a GraphQL backend API are: 
- resolver developments only **focuses on data retrieval, filtering, returns**
- GraphQL implicitly handles all the objects transformation complexity, i.e., nesting, list appending, etc.

## Resolve as Fields Traversals

When a query is made to an Endpoint, GraphQL applies multiple steps: 
1. apply the *root Resolver* at the Query Endpoint - hence the common expression of `resolver(root, info, **kwargs)` in backend libraries
2. use a *breath-first* to execute all the Field's Resolvers and gather the results
3. for each results, traverse to the next Schema if there are any Object Type Fields
4. traverse until there are not more Object Type Fields, i.e., only String, Int, etc..
5. GraphQL implicitly transformed all the Traversal results and return back to client.
