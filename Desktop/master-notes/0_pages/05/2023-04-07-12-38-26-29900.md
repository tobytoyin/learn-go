## What is a Stream Processing System?

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230407124853.png|500]] ^stream-system ^293ede

A *Stream Processing System* sits between an Online System and [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-35-58-33600|Batch Processing]] System.  ^f79f0a

- **Similarity to Online System**
	- uses Clients to trigger some Process, i.e, event-based invocation 
	- needs to response efficiently to generate results (near real time responses)
- **Similarity to Batch Processing** 
	- consumes batch of data within an "event window" rather than handling requests to fetch batch of files
	- produces outputs at some locations
- **Distinctive to Stream Processing** ^ee397a
	- *unbounded event data* - don't know whether the system contains all the data or not at a particular time interval
	- *incrementally available* - data are continuously coming in and needs to update and refresh wrt to new data
	- *ill-defined intervals* - data cannot be clearly breakdown into n-time interval batch jobs, e.g., due to infrequent intervals & high frequency intervals

Because it is a mixture of both Online System and Batch Processing, the key performance measures the entire response handling speed, i.e., both react to events as quickly and efficient computation.

## Event Streaming Process

![[3_hidden/_images/event-system-20221220162731.png|500]]

The core part of any Stream Processing System is to be able to handle *Event Streaming Process*. This requires a system to be able to: 
- capture streaming data produced from *Producer* systems
- distribute streaming data to *Consumer* systems for downstream processes

There are different types of stream processing patterns used on top of handling event streaming process, e.g., : 

- *topics* - separating different kind of event streams
- *[[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-29-17-10-21|pub-sub]]* - decentralised and reactive approach to distribute streaming data
- *[[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-29-17-06-35|broker]]* - centralised approach to receive and distribute data and acts as a buffer
- *[[0_pages/02/d-2023-10-29-17-03-40|direct messaging]]* - immediate streaming data consumption and processing

Different kinds of technologies commonly focuses and mix these paradigms, while sacrifice some aspects of others.

## Event Streaming vs traditional Database

In its simplest form, an Event Streaming System operates similar to how engineers interact with a traditional database. 

![[3_hidden/_images/poll-20221220164023.png]]

Both Database and Streaming Topics can be read by others. However traditional databases cannot handle well ==when the Database receives high frequency writes and low delay reads==, while ==Event Streaming applications are to support low latency== from both write ("publish") and read ("poll").

Database uses "Triggers" to react to database changes, while Topics uses "Notifications" reacting to new streaming inputs. 

Some other optimisation for streaming database (like Broker) is to remove many features that are uniquely for relational operation and aggregation, e.g., Search Indexes.
