## Batch Processing System

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230407124956.png|500]] ^batch-system ^147aff

A *Batch Processing System* focuses on loading and processing large amount of data that are stored at some locations (*Data Sources*) and generate the outputs at some locations (*Data Sinks*). This type of system don't take requests from Clients but run periodically at certain time as a Job.  ^9c9e98

The key performance measures how quickly a Job completes (*throughput rate*). 

> [!note]- Offline System 
> It is also called as *Offline System* since there are no Clients.

## How Batch Processing is used?

Batch Processing System's uses set between both "analytic database" and "transactional database".

Similar to Analytics Database, it needs to process/ aggregate large data periodically.  Instead of just create a single use report but ==to support some application==. This application supports don't need to be access/ update as frequent as a Transactional Database.
