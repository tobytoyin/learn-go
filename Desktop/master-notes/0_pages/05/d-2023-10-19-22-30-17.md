## Enum

*Enum* is a type that provides a set of valid values: 

```graphql
enum Weekday {
	MON
	TUE
	WED
	THR
}
```

An [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-19-16-10-50|Object Type]] can indicate that the String returns is from a special Enum value: 

```graphql
type Event {
	date: String!
	description: String
	weekday: Weekday!
}
```

---
## Interface

*Interface* shares the same concept as [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800#Composition Design ("HAS-A" relationship)|interface in OOP]]. An Object Type is to "has-a" interface when it contains the required Fields specified by an `interface` type. 

```graphql
interface License {
	id: String!
	location: String!
	expirationDate: String!
}
```

Below objects share the same `License` interface: 

```graphql
type FoodLicense implements License {
	id: String!
	location: String!
	expirationDate: String!
	category: String!
	origin: String!
}

type VehicleLicense implements License {
	id: String!
	location: String!
	expirationDate: String!
	vehicleType: String!
	owner: Person!
}
```

Note: `interface` is useful when combined with [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-19-22-05-30|fragments]] to reuse the same Fields

## Union Type

*Union Type* is useful to indicate that a [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-19-16-17-11|Query's]] return objects could be a mixed of multiple [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-19-16-10-50|Object Types]]. E.g., 

```graphql
type Employee {
	id: String!
	name: String!
	department: String!
}

type Contractor {
	id: String!
	name: String!
	vendor: String!
}

type User = Employee | Contractor

# query that might return a User (Employee / Contractor)
type Query {
	getUser(id: String!): User
}
```
