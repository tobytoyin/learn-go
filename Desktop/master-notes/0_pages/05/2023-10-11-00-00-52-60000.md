   _Strategy Design Pattern_ is a design method that refactors out algorithms/ business logics within a single process. The key is to allow a program to swap between different processing methods like plugins.

This allows class behaviour to be changed at the runtime without having to redeploy the main application.

## Terminologies

-   _Strategy Interface_ - contains the methods & attributes that Context depends on
-   _Strategy Object -_ is the implementation of the Strategy Interface, commonly the application‚Äôs use cases
-   _Context_ - is the main class or object that coordinate with the core functionality and uses the Strategy

## Refactor Logical Components

The major factor that Strategy Patten aims to refactor out is the implementation details of different scenarios (use cases) but the overall process remains the same.

<aside> üí≠ For example:

-   A Machine Learning Process that follows the same procedure but varies in choosing different Computation </aside>

Instead of putting all the implementation details within the Context class, we can refactor them out. This is based on the acknowledgement that Context doesn‚Äôt needs to know how a result is being computed, it only ‚Äúneeds‚Äù the result. This allows the Context to reliable to call methods/ attributes from a Strategy Interface to get certain dependent results, while the details of those are implemented through different Strategies Objects.

<aside> üí≠ A Strategy Pattern is like a boss. It doesn‚Äôt need to know how the job is being done but it only needs to ensure that the job is being done and results are being delivered.

## Spotting Strategy Patterns

One way to spot the needs to refactor business logics into Strategy Objects is when your program is starting handling lots of if-else statement. For example, from the below flow diagrams, we can see that there are lots of logical decisions that is dependent on the inputs, while the follow-up logics are only acting the outputs directly.

We can apply Strategy Pattern by making each logical decision dependencies into a separate Strategy Object with a common abstract interface that allows the program to access any different objects using the same command.

## Why Strategy Pattern is good?

Strategy Design Pattern ensures changes to an application more stable. By refactoring out the implementation details of different scenarios into different Strategy Objects, this allows the code bases of the Context (application) remains unchanged.

Because the Context can always expect to retrieve the results/ computation it needed from the Strategy Object, as long as it doesn‚Äôt require additional functionalities, new developments can simply be done by making new Strategy Objects without touching the Context.
