## High Level Design

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-25-17-09#^hld]]

This design resemblance ETL process, by which we separate different stages to these terms:
- `SourceHandler` - refers the E & T processes. This processes on the unified `Source` object ‚Üí extract information from those documents ‚Üí transform into `Document`
- `Task` - refers to the L process.This involves processes that use a unified set `Document` objects and execute different kinds of load processes based on different implemented tasks for different connectors (see [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-15-16-50-37|Service Catalog]])

## Document Abstraction

An abstraction in defining a document object, it should implement the following interfaces: 
- `doc.id` - represents the unique id of a document
- `doc.metadata(...)` - returns the metadata key-value pair of a document
- `doc.relations(...)` - return a set of document id that has a directed relationship
