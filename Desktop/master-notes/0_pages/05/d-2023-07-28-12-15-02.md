## Creating New Roles

When managing Roles and privileges for users to perform specific tasks, it is commonly done by assigning a *Role*. A Role limits the Services Accesses one can perform: 

There are several existing *System Defined Roles* to perform certain actions: 
- `ACCOUNTADMIN` - root admin that can do everything with the account
- `SYSADMIN` - Role that can modify the privileges of account's resources
- `SECURITYADMIN` - Role that can modify the account's security configs
- `USERADMIN` - Role that can modify the privileges of account's Users 

To create a new Role, we need to first create an empty Role:

```sql
--execute command using a higher previlage role
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN; 

CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE <someRole>;
```

Then it is common to add more privileges to an Role by:
- [[#Granting Privileges|Selectively grant more privileges]] (*grant options*) from scratch 
- Combine and inherit from multiple Roles to form an Role (see [[0_pages/05/d-2023-07-28-21-36-06|here]])

## Granting Privileges 

To grant new privileges to specific Roles, it generally follows this syntax: 

```sql
GRANT <privilegeType> ON <object> TO ROLE <someRole>;
```
