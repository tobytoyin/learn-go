As [[0_pages/54/d-2023-11-15-12-47-01|Object Storage]]'s data are replaced when an object with the same Key is uploaded in the storage system. Data consistency cannot sorely relies on a single ObjStore. 

To ensure read clients are always getting the most up-to-date objects ([[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-17-26-49-89800|Consistency]]) in [[0_pages/54/d-2023-11-15-12-47-01|Object Storage]] usually involves an additional ACID (or strong consistency) database as an "*objects metastore*". 

The object metastore DB is only responsible to store the metadata (e.g., upload date, size) of an object key. While the Object Storage is responsible of storing the actual object.

## Write Object

When writing an object to the ObjStore, this involves two steps: 
- create object key and write objects into ObjStore by Key
- add/ update the metadata into the DB by the same object's Key 

For example, when an object keyed as `object-12345` is added into ObjStore, the metastore DB would also contain a record `object-12345` with that object's metadata.

## Get Object

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230429221714.png|500]]

When getting objects from the ObjStore, this involves two steps to ensure reader is always getting the most up-to-date objects: 
- Client is getting the object from ObjStore by Key & getting the metadata from metaStore by Key
- check if the metadata of the retrieved object is the same as the metadata retrieved from the metaStore
	- if they are the same, object is up-to-date; return the obj
	- if they are the same, object is lagged; retry the process recursively
