# Convolution with Adjacency Matrix 

## Adjacency Matrix

*Adjacency Matrix* ($A$) is a matrix indicating the immediate neighbours of one node. 
For example: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230212120843.png|500]]^adjacency-matrix


- Node1 (row 1) is connected to Node2, 3 (column 2, 3) - denote as 1
- Node2 (row 2) is connected to only Node1 (column 1) - denote as 1
- ...


> [!NOTE]- Diagonal
> Sometimes, nodes itself is also considered as it's own neighbour and included into aggregation. The Adjacency Matrix for this has a diagonal = 1 ($A_{v, v} = 1$)

## Adjacency Matrix as Nodes Traversals

One important usage of Adjacency Matrix is that it can act as *Node Traversals* from one Node to its neighbours. If we have a vector $h$ representing Nodes, computing $A h$ would sums up the representations of its neighbours into a new vector $h'$.

> [!Example]- Traversal Step-by-Step
> ### 1st Traversal
> During the first traversal $h' = Ah$, Node1 with value $a$ becomes $b+c$ because both Node2 and Node3 are Node1 immediate neighbours. 
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230212120824.png|500]]
> 
> ### 2nd Traversal
> During the 2nd traversal (i.e., from the traversed Nodes to their neighbours) $h'' = Ah'$, the second immediate neighbours of Node1's first neighbours values are summed into the vector.

### Finding Neighbours' Neighbours
We can think of multiple traversals as finding the "neighbours' neighbours" for $d$ times, i.e., hooping from neighbours to another. In general, if we need to find the sum of neighbours Nodes after $d$ traverses: 
$$h' = A^dh$$
```python
# in numpy
h_traversed = matrix_power(A, d).dot(h)
```

## Localised Convolution

Convolution in a graph is like a "*neighbours traversing*" aggregation at a local Node. In essence, if we need to convolute a set of Nodes by traversing $d$ times (i.e., convoluting neighbours for $d$ hoops). We can simply sum all the Node Traversals: 
$$
h_{conv} = \sum_{i=0}^{d}A^dh 
$$
For example, to convolve Nodes for 2 traversals ($d=2$): 
$$
h_{d=2} = A^0h + A^1h + A^2h = Ih + Ah + A^2h
$$

> [!Tip]- Convolution Graphically
> Graphically, the convolution sums the Node's neighbours vectors at each traversal: 
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230212120746.png|500]]
> By only focusing Node1 (row1) of $h$:
> - 1st vector $h^{(1)}$
> 	- original $h$ representation with no traversal ($d=0$)
> 	- no neighbours $h_1 \rightarrow \{h_1\}$
> - 2nd vector $h^{(2)}$
> 	- neighbours' representations with 1 traversal ($d=1$) 
> 	- neighbours $h_1 \rightarrow \{h_2, h_3\}$
> - 3rd vector $h^{(3)}$
> 	- neighbours' representations with 2 traversals ($d=2$)
> 	- neighbours $h_2 \rightarrow \{h_1\}; h_3 \rightarrow \{h_1, h_4\}$
> - then summing all these neighbours vectors' representations
^convolve

> [!note]- Non Matrix Iterative Form 
> The above formulation considers all Nodes arranged in a form of vector/ matrix. In some cases, we might want to use an iterative approach: 
> - for the current Node ($h_v$) to iterate over the all neighbours Nodes ($h_u$)
> - $A^d$ - being neighbours indicator matrix - replaced by index lookup of neighbours using a *adjacency list*
> - $A^dh$ summation operation - replaced by $\sum{h_u}$ over all the neighbour Nodes

## Other Considerations

### Different Aggregation Methods
$A^dh$ is a summation process, which makes the convolution a sum aggregation. Many [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-04-47-45300|different algorithms]] are doing convolution differently by replacing the Adjacency Matrix  and follow a general form:
$$
Conv(M) = \sum_{i=0}^{d}M^dh
$$
Most notably, $M$ being Laplacian Graph $L$ or Averaged Adjacency Matrix $A_{avg}$.

### Undirected Convolutions
One important aspect in using Adjacency Matrix to traverse is that it allows neighbours to travel back to the origin Node (*undirected graph*). In the [[#^convolve|example]], we can see that the 2nd traversal is adding back $2a$ in Node1 from Node2 and Node3.
