## ？ What is Hive?

Hadoop is a platform which provides tools for processing big data. This includes tools that are used for storing, computing, analysing big data under the [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|Distributed System]] paradigm.

Being a cluster computing “system”, ==_Hive_ is the relational database implementation on top of Hadoop's distributed filesystem==. _Hive Query Language_ (HQL) is similar to SQL, which is familiar to many data analyst, to script data processing operations in Hive.

> [!tip] Hive & Hadoop Technology
> Storage - integrate with [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]] as the database storage
> Compute - use [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|MapReduce]] as the database computation

## 🆚 Hive vs RDBMS

What differs Hive from _Relational Database Managed Service_ (RDBMS) is that Hive aims to complement RDBMS for process big data using familiar SQL-like syntax rather than replacing it.

> [!example]- Some RDBMS are Postgres, Oracle SQL, etc.

Here are some key unique features of Hive over RDBMS:

- **Schema on Read** 
	- Hive has a “schema on read” approach, which infers the schema without handling schematic errors on read, while RDBMS has a “schema on write” approach, which requires a schema being straightly defined beforehand. 
- **Query different data**
	- Because Hive doesn’t rely on a pre-defined schema (schema on read), this allows Hive to query data that are structured (tabular), semi-structured, or unstructured; while RDBMS can only query structured data. This allows Hive to make relational operation between many different data sources.
- **Usage & Tasks**
	- Because Hive has more flexibility without a schema, this makes it slower and supports high latency queries only. RDBMS with straight schema allows it to computes much faster at a lower latency.
	- This makes Hive more suitable for [Data Warehouse](https://www.notion.so/Data-Warehouse-4737465240414181bdda0604f850479d), house-keeping, or data consumption tasks. While RDBMS is more suitable for transactions or application tasks.

## 🔁 Hive Workflow

![[3_hidden/_images/hive-workflow-20221212113633.png|700]]

Hive SQL is executed against Hadoop's [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]] based on [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|Distributed MapReduce]] tasks. Hive's uses a cluster driver to create a *Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)* that determines the optimal way to compute MapReduce results. Once the computation is completed, it writes back to HDFS and communicate back to the Driver Node.
