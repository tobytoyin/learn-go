*Singleton Pattern* is a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800|Design Pattern]] that emphasises on: 
- only allowing one class being instantiated
- single point of interaction
- (usually) static and non-modifiable after instantiation and setup

---
## üìñ Use Cases Traits

- avoid unscoped access & use of global variables
	- when an application relies on lots of global variables, a Singleton object is ideal as a way to **provide a class that ensure valid-modification of values; traceable properties**
- single registry/ management of information across the entire application
	- when static **information needs to be accessed everywhere in an application** (e.g., session, metadata of some master server)
	- when static information needs to be fixed and not open to modification. This avoids crucial properties being modified unintentionally and crashes the programme (e.g. multi-threading & [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|distributed]] tasks)
	- when information can be changed in any modules and don't have a direct way to invoke it from other classes (e.g., broken lineage )
- resource intensive initialisation
	- when setup only needs to run once and available throughout the entire application lifecycle (e.g., setup a connection with another service)
	- when setup takes a lot of resources and ideally should only run once (e.g., running a chain of modules to retrieve data that can be reused later)
	- when setup needs to be *lazily evaluated*, i.e., instantiated only when needed
- application needs a unified "controller"/ "orchestrator" to manage all parts
	- when an application needs an unified object to contain all information to coordinate different processes in an application
	  (we can call this "*information coupled*" rather than "class coupled")
	- e.g., status of whether some modules can be run; information that is needed for one module that is generated from some way else
- dependency inversion
	- when a class is becoming the centre of every parts of an application, we can convert it into a singleton that depends on nothing of its clients

## Design

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230312211113.png|500]]^singleton

The implementation of Singleton class is simple: 
- a `Context` class that 
	- serves as an point of interaction to external (i.e., `public`)
	- contains states of the singleton class
- a `Singleton` class can only be instantiated within `Context`
	- it is `private` and lives inside the scope of the `Context`, making it impossible for external clients to reference it other than from `Context`
- when interacting with `Context`, it is usually executed in a "*get or create*" manner: 
	- instantiated the `Singleton` for the 1st time once 
	- or retrieve the one that already exists

### How Clients use Singleton?
To use the singleton class, different clients would: 
1. communicate with the `Context` to get a reference of the Singleton class

---
## Common Usage 

- Singleton is commonly named as `App()`, `Session()`, etc... 
- `Context` is sometime called `Launcher`, `Builder`, etc.. which emphasis the purpose of creating a Singleton Class
