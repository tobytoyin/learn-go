# Basic Pods Deployment 


## Deployment in K8s 

A *Deployment* in Kubernetes is about deploying containerised applications (*Image*) into the [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Cluster]]. This can come as in mainly two ways:
- [[#New Deployment]] - create/ update new instances of your containerised applications
- [[#Scaling Deployment]] - update existing instances of your containerised applications

1. Generally these deployments follow a similar [[#K8s Deployment Flow|workflow]] in creating Pods and deploying them. 
2. Deployment are *"declarative" of a Desired State* of a cluster

## New Deployment

K8s deployment (`kubectl create deployment ...`) follows a common workflow:

1. Deployment are created and ==request to the K8s API==
2. API would create different orchestration tasks: 
	- create a Pod's [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700#🪞 ReplicaSet|ReplicaSet]] 
	- create deployment record to the *etcd* database 
	- create a deployment schedule in the *scheduler*
3. ReplicaSet are handled by a [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700#🕹 Controller|Controller]] to determine what to deploy
	1. Pods metadata are record to etcd
	2. scheduler and c-m deploy the Pods to Worker Node
4. Pods are handled by kubelet agent in each Node and create the containers

## Scaling Deployment

Scaling more Pods is also a type of deployment (`kubectl scale ...` ). This is because K8s uses a similar methodology to deploy more/ less new Pods: 
1. CLI declaratively indicates how many Pods need to be deployed (Desired State)
2. c-m creates a *Change Set* required for Current State to be Desired State
	- Number of Pods to replica from a specific ReplicaSet 
	- Create a deployment detail to a scheduler
3. A ChangeSet is defined by a [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700#🕹 Controller|Controller]] to determine what to update
4. kubelet handles new Pods requests then create containers inside Nodes
