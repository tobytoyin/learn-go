The main purpose of Serialising [[Data Models]] is to allow data (e.g., structured, unstructured) to flow from one location to another location. 

For example: 
- transmitting data/ results from one software to another software
- data sharing in a Data Lake

## Basics Data Serialisation

The most basic form of serialisation is to **store only the value of the data** (e.g., string, integer, float) from one environment into another environment.

For example, this could be a software transmitting data to another software using JSON format . This involves serialise-deserialise text files into Map-like objects of each programming languages (`dict`, `Map`, etc.). This allows environments with different programming languages to communicate (since JSON are commonly included as the core library in modern programming languages).

Examples are: JSON, CSV.

## Rich Data Serialisation

Another form of serialisation involves storing metadata along with data values. This might involves storing additional: 
- schema, fields & data types, structure of Data Models
- compression of the Data (e.g., columnar compression)

This process is often done by specific frameworks to serialise into a standardised format; both ends need to have the same software implemented in their own programming language to convert those data into their language's eqv. 

Examples are: Avro, Arrow
