## Data Vault

Data Vault is influenced by [[0_pages/03/2023-03-13-21-51-27-93200|Domain Driven Designs]] approach in terms of modelling, describing, and breaking down data into different Tables. 

In general, Data Vault modelling focuses on: 
- storing Factual Data as an independent records relate to different *Domain Objects*
- storing Descriptions/ Context about Domain Objects as separates Tables

## Data Vault Tables

To model the relationships among Factual Data and Business Domain. It relies on organising data into 3 types of Tables: 

- *Hubs* - table that contains core business concepts/ objects (i.e., Domain Objects) as a single object key
- *Links* - relationships among different Domain Objects in a single transaction ([[0_pages/03/d-2023-08-25-13-48-49|Unit of Work]])
- *Satellites* - storing the descriptive details about each of the Hub and Link
	- *Hubs' Satellites* - contains and describe the details of each Domain Object (i.e., [[wip/d-2023-10-24-23-02-24|Dimension Table]])
	- *Link's Satellites* - contains the records of all Links' events (i.e., [[wip/d-2023-10-24-23-02-24|Fact Table]])

## Example

- Hub could contain `Products` with `product_id`; `Customers` with `cust_id`
- Hub's Satellites contains columns such as: `product_name`, `product_origin` for each `product_id`
- Links contains the transaction records of `Products` sold to `Customers` linked with `priduct_id`, `cust_id`, and `transaction_id`
- Links Satellites contains the details of each transaction, e.g., `price`, `transaction_date`, etc...

## Benefits

The main benefit of Data Vault is to have a clear separation between immutable natural of Domain Objects in a single transaction; and mutable context about a Domain Object. This allows: 
- updating/ refactoring of Schema about Domain Objects only in Satellites Tables
- immutable Links that store Records and relationships between Domain Objects
