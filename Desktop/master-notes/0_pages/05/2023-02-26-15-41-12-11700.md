# Database Index 

---

   

## What is Index?

Databases generally would use *index* to efficiently find data among the storage. An Index is like a "signpost" of the data storage, providing information on the location of records and retrieve the value of those data. 

Generally when we talk about "querying a database", what the system does is to **look at the "index page" of a database and look for the individual records that satisfy the query**. How quick and efficient a database search information highly depends on how Indexes are being implemented.

## Why databases need Index?

A database without Index is inefficient to search. This is because the log's file need to store all the Index along with its values; if retrieval by Index is done, the system would need to read through the entire log file to search for the right Index & data.

Using an Index can skip the detail on the data contents and just lookup for the key (which is faster) and then use the respective value to locate the data contents.

> Another way to think of Index in database is how book index different pages in a Content Page. By looking up the Content Page, we can quickly find out the location of each chapter we are looking for.

## 🗂️ Two Types of Indexes

In a database, there are commonly two core Index: 

- ***Records Index (Primary Index)***
	Is like a registry for the database to ==locate individual unique records== (e.g., Rows in SQL, Documents in NoSQL). This type of Index is generally implemented by the database itself.

- ***Search Index (Secondary Index)***
	This is generally setup to allow some common search and joins to run more efficiently by quickly ==locate a subset of records==. This type of Index is implemented by developers on top the database core.
