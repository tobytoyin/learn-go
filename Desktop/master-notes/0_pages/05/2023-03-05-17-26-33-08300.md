# Atomicity 


Atomicity Transaction indicates that the Transaction Unit that writes to a database is at the "atomic" level that cannot be further break apart. 

The central objective of this is to ensure a transaction has a "all-or-nothing" results, i.e., either success/ failed writes, and there is no partial success/ failure.  ^b146df

> Success - `commit`
> Failure - `abort`/ `rollback`

## Non-Atomic Transaction

A non-atomic transaction would mean that all the write queries that defined within an single execution are executed independently. This would lead to problem when any of the queries within the execution failed unexpectedly. The databases would be full of partial results from multiple queries.

## Atomic Transaction

A "Atomicity" compliant transaction would only commit to a new database when all the queries within a Transaction are completed successfully. 
If any part of the Transaction failed, the "writes logs" of the database would be invalid and rollback to the previous state.

## Single & Multiple Objects Transaction

Because queries are usually more complex involving many steps of read & writes, there are different ways a database groups different objects in a Transaction: 
- **Multiple Objects**
	- all the queries wrapped around by `BEGIN TRANSACTION ... COMMIT` statements are considered as a single Transaction. Any query within failed considered the Transaction failed. 

- **Single Object**
	- typically for a transaction with large bytes size. A Transaction failed and recover based on the log file if a single object writes failed (corrupted records).

## Why we need Atomicity?

The major problem of Non-Atomic compliant writes is when a transaction consists of multiple logical steps. ==Atomicity Transaction ensure that all the logical steps in-between are followed without any potential faults due to partial success==.

For example, in this example: 
1. update some records by primary keys (#1)
2. read the updated records by primary keys (#2)
3. summarise those records and write to somewhere else (#3)

‚úÖ Ideally when all the queries are executed properly, we can ensure #3 would be writing the correct results. 
‚ùå However, if #1 somehow failed in its execution, #2 would be retrieving old records before the updates (#1); #3 would be summarising the wrong records.
