There are commonly 2 ways to design [[0_pages/05/d-2023-07-27-14-33-24#Roles Hierarchy|Roles Architectures]]: 
- *functional level* - structure privileges based on more/ fewer functional tasks
- *system level* - structure privileges based on application/ system layers

## Functional Level

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230728213310.png|500]]

Privileges are granted and inherited **based on functional/ seniority level within a business**. For example: 
- more senior developers would have more privileges to perform more tasks
- wider functional facing business roles would inherit more privileges

### SQL Example 

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- setup all roles
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE SENIOR_ANALYST;
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE JUNIOR_ANALYST;
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE INTERN_ANALYST;

-- setup roles hierarchy relationship
GRANT ROLE INTERN_ANALYST TO ROLE JUNIOR_ANALYST;
GRANT ROLE JUNIOR_ANALYST TO ROLE SENIOR_ANALYST;
```

## System (Layers) Level

Privileges are granted based on application-level dependencies. For example, we might want to grant the least privileges required for different system applications: 
- ETL engine to allow have Databases/ Tables write access
- Visualisation engine to only have Tables read access
- etc..

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-07-28-11-18#^layer-privileges]]

Since Snowflake [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-10-39-78700#ü´ô Data Silo Problems|aims to reduce Data silos]], we can broadly design structure the Roles & Privileges based on system-layers across multiple applications: 
- Monitor Layer - inherits all Roles that are related to Monitoring
- ETL Layer - inherits all Roles that are related to ETL
- etc..

### SQL Example

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN; 

-- roles for application 1 
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE DB1_MONITOR;
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE DB1_VIEWS;

-- roles for application 2
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE DB2_MONITOR;
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE DB2_VIEWS;

-- roles for system's services layers
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE MONITOR_LAYER;
CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE VIEWS_LAYER; 

-- create hierarchy
GRANT ROLE DB1_MONITOR TO ROLE MONITOR_LAYER;
GRANT ROLE DB2_MONITOR TO ROLE MONITOR_LAYER;

GRANT ROLE DB1_VIEWS TO ROLE VIEWS_LAYER;
GRANT ROLE DB2_VIEWS TO ROLE VIEWS_LAYER;
```
