# Name Node 

A _Name Node_ is the central of a Hadoop cluster. It has the following major roles to play:

-   maintaining the metadata of [Data Node](https://www.notion.so/Data-Node-c9d4e00dbf4d44fb87eafd4ae246a8b3), e.g., where the required is stored, their computational resources, etc.
-   communicate externally with client application for instruction
-   communicate internally with cluster’s data nodes to retrieve and process data
-   being the major/ partial Driver of a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|cluster]]

## 🚗 Driver of Cluster

At Hadoop 1.X, the Name Node originally takes up the entire role of a Driver within a cluster. The Name Node passes down the things it needs to compute for each Data Node, keeping track of the progress, and gather the results.

At Hadoop 2.X, the co-ordination role of the Driver has passed on to [YARN](https://www.notion.so/YARN-e1b8dca44605450f8e40b814285fe3e4), while the Name Node mainly focus on handling the requests from clients and maintaining metadata.

## 🚨 Fault Tolerance Approach
### Secondary Name Node

A _Name Node_ would also generates a _Secondary Name Node_ as a backup of the metadata in the primary Name Node. When a Name Node fails, the Secondary Name Node could restore the metadata, e.g., data address, to prevent total lost of data.

However, the secondary name node is not actively running and restoring data needs to be done manually.

### Passive Name Node

At Hadoop 2.X, it introduced _Passive Name Node_, which runs at a standby mode with the same configuration as the primary Name Node.

This means when a cluster is running, two different Name Nodes are alive to handle commands. The primary one is actively handling write & read command to the Data Nodes; the Passive Name Node is “passively” communicating and read from Data Nodes, for which the Data Node can switch to the passive Name Node when the primary one fails.

> [!note]
> The Passive Name Node aims to handle the single point of failure when a single Name Node fails. This is like having a backup power to keep facility running even when the major one dies off.
