A Domain Model can allow domain experts to express, design, implement new processes within a system based on their own *Domain Language* (i.e., jargon).

## The importance of Domain Language

Often Jargons is an **encapsulation of complex process/ properties** that already exist within a domain. Experts use them to save time/ words to explain the whole process. Commonly are: 
- *rules & assumptions* 
	- a product in the supply chain domain could imply some "rules", e.g., "cannot stock shelf when products amount below some amount"; "flag stock warning when some products drop below some rates"
- *properties & attributes* 
	- a "company" within a finance domain could mean a collection of rates & ratios that can be derived from certain figures
- *standard procedures* 
	- a delivery service domain always have "procedures" to prefix/ suffix the source/ destination country codes

## Domain Language as Encapsulation

These Jargons represents a higher *abstractions* of commonly used ideas within a domain. When implementing components in a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-13-21-51-27-93200|Domain Model]], they should **provides an easy, out-of-the-box way to reference, retrieve** those representations. 


> [!Example]- Finance Domain Example
> Say if we are to define a "company" for a finance domain system: 
> - instead of calculating an ratio every time it needs to be used
> - encapsulate them as common attributes/ method within a class for easy access

## Domain Language Designs 

In design models for these domain logics, we can either embrace: 
- [[0_pages/03/2023-03-11-15-33-03-38700|Value Object Pattern]] - when there are many well defined domain entities and relevant logics/ procedures that acts on entity's level information
- [[2023-03-11-16-21-55-39700|Domain Service Function]] - when there are many interactions between domain entities, which is more suited to use [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800|composition]]
