# 📓 Security Concerns in Data Engineering

## Least Privilege Access 

Only provides data and access that is required for the job. This emphasises on the use of *whitelist* to open require permission to specific users/ roles in the Cloud. 

---
## Column Encryption 

Some confidential data might need to be extracted and stored in database & storage systems. Instead of storing the raw values, we should store them as *encrypted column* and decrypted them when needed. 

Many data storage technologies already provided `ENCRYPT` functions:
