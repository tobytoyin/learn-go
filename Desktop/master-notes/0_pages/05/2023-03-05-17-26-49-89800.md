# Consistency 


"Consistency" is an approach that the database's connectors should take in order to ensure that all data would be in a good state, after completing a Transaction. Essentially, this is the "*validator*" in the application. ^781935

> [!Tip]- "Good State" Data
> This means database contains no faulty information; up-to-date information, etc.

Although it is not a property within the database, some databases (Postgres) contains some simple constraints before committing any transactions. 

> [!example]- Consistency in some use cases
> Some examples are: 
> - Financial databases need to have a balance credit & debit book keeping
> - Sales orders cannot lead to negative stocks & inventories

## How to ensure "Consistency"?

To ensure a Transaction won't lead to faulty records. The connector needs execute some queries to validate that operations won't mess up the database. 

For example: 
- a Client would receive some data for make a Transaction into the database (e.g., buying some products)
- a "Consistency" compliant Client would need to execute an "Read" statement to validate if product's stock exist within the Transaction
	- commit Transaction when validated (stocks exist)
	- reject when not validated

> [!note]- Concurrency During Validation
> It is possible to face "Race condition" during the validation read phase. For example, another customer bought the items when another customer try to make a Transaction.
