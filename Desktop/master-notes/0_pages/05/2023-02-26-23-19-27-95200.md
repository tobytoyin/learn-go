# Graph Embeddings 

## Embeddings in Classical NN

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230209223857.png]]^nn-embeddings
In classic Neural Networks, input features are trained for the *Hidden Layers* and generate outputs. The Hidden Layers are equivalently the "embeddings" of each feature.

## Representation Learning

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230209232001.png|500]]^graph-embeddings

A [[Property Graph Model|Graph]] contains 3 major components: *nodes*, *edges*, and *global context*. Each of these components contain their own properties (features), which like classic neural networks, can be learnt into [[latent representations|embeddings]] to represent some meaning with respect to the whole graph: 

- *Node Embedding* - latent meaning of a Node
- *Edge Embedding* - latent meaning of Node to Node relationship
- *Global Embedding* - latent meaning of the entire graph

Each of these embeddings are *n-dimensional matrix* that can be used to represent every individual nodes, edges, and the graph's context. For example, a Node based on its properties values, relationship with other Nodes, would have an unique embedding.

## Embeddings Notations


![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230209230956.png|500]]^notation

In mathematical notations: 
- $V$ ($\#nodes \times \#dim$) 
	- is a matrix of all the Nodes' embeddings ($v_i$) within a graph 
	- number of Nodes x latent dimension
- $E$ ($\#edges \times \#dim$)
	- is a matrix of all Edges' embeddings ($e_i$) within a graph
	- number of Edges x latent dimension
- $U$ ($1 graph \times \#dim$)
	- is (usually) a vector embedding ($u_i$) of a single input graph
	- 1 graph x latent dimension
