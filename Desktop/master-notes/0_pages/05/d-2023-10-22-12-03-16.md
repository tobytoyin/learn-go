## echo

`echo` is the most common way to **write text to a single file**:

```shell
# write mode 
echo "some text" > myFile.txt

# append mode
echo "some text" >> myFile.txt
```

---
## tee

`tee` is an additional to writing files with `echo`, which is useful for scenarios such as:
- using `sudo` to write files in system directory, e.g., `/etc`
- writing into multiple files at the same time

`tee` could do the same thing as `echo` but allow writing files as root user `sudo`:

```shell
# write mode
echo "some text" | sudo tee /etc/myFile.txt

# append mode
echo "some text" | sudo tee -a /etc/myFile.txt
```

`tee` is more efficient when writing to multiple files: 

```shell
# write mode
echo "some text" | tee myFile1.txt myFile2.txt

# append mode
echo "some text" | tee -a myFile1.txt myFile2.txt
```
