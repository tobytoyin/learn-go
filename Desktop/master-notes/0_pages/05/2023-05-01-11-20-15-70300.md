Traditional [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|Partitioning]] is done horizontally (row-based) or vertically (column-based). Both of these approaches follow the same principle in using "Index" as partitioning and physical location allocation.

## Row-based Partitioning

*Horizontal (row-based) Partitioning* (sharding) simply breaks the full Table into smaller Tables based on their Row Index (e.g., based on number of rows count as one partition).

## Column-based Partitioning

*Vertical (column-based) Partitioning* (row-splitting) breaks the full Table into smaller Tables based on the distinct values of specified column(s). 

This approach mainly aims for storage optimisation by compressing column's values through *normalisation* (truncating the column from the Table used in partitioning). This allows Tables being stored with few columns.
