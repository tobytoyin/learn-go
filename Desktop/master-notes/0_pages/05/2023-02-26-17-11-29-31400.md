# Shared-Disk Architecture 

![[3_hidden/_images/shared-disk-20221127115216.png]]

The "Shared-Disk" architecture is one way to scale by making data accessible to more compute Nodes (users). 

- All the data are stored in a centralised disk
- horizontally scaled by adding more compute Nodes, which: 
	- allow larger data retrieval and computation (more Nodes, more CPUs)
	- allow more users to interact with the database (more Nodes, more clients)

## Problems

When there are more Nodes & clients interacting with the database, it would make it problematic to have [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-56-12100|concurrent writes]]. 
By adding in transaction lock on the database, this limits the actual scalability of the system (i.e., additional Nodes are locked from writing new data).
