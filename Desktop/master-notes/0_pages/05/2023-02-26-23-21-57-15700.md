# Kubernetes Key Ideas 

*Kubernetes (K8s)* is an implementation of [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200#🕸️ What is a Distributed System?|Distributed System]] through distributing sets of containers across multiple Worker Nodes.

K8s is higher level abstraction of container that "*packaging containers*" as a deployment unit (i.e., [[#💊 Pod]]), making each Pod a distributed unit in a system. 

In contrast to classic distributed system (single Node runs a single process), K8s can setup many processes inside a single Node. This makes it more efficient to:
- decouple hardwares with process distribution, i.e., use few Nodes to distribute more processes; keeping Nodes as constant (because processes are cheap & machines are expensive)
- dynamics & efficient scaling of containerised services

## Cluster Architecture

K8s shares similar architecture as a regular distributed system, having both [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200#🤴🏻 Master Node|Master Node]] and [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200#👷🏻 Worker Node|Worker Nodes]]. K8s relies on *Control Panel* as a "Master" to mange and orchestrate the cluster through various [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300#🕹 Control Panel Processes|Control Panel Process]], while Worker Nodes are used to host the containerised applications.

🐳 All Nodes inside K8s have a container engine (e.g. Docker engine) pre-installed, so that each Node could have the capability to deploy and run containers.

## Ways of Communication

![[1_catalog/14/2023-01-01-20-50#^fa2037]]

When a client interact with a K8s cluster, it relies on a communication with the K8s API Gateway, i.e, the cluster [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300#🕹 Control Panel Processes|Control Panel]] API service. 

API coordinates with various Control Panel Processes to orchestrate all the setup, then it instructs Worker Nodes to deploy containers (through Pods) in the cluster. **The K8s API can be thought of as the "centre" of the entire K8s cluster**.

## 💊 Pod

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20221231235223.png|500]]

A *[[0_pages/92/d-2023-11-16-16-17-45|Pod]]* is a **smallest deployment unit** when deploying into Worker Nodes. A Pod defines of a collection of Containers and are set up on a running Node. This is essentially the "container" that "containerising other containers". ==A single Pod is often defined as a single application that is tightly coupled by multiple micro application containers==. 

Pods lived inside a Node and one Node can contain multiple Pods (same kind of Pod or different Pods). This is similar to how a single machine can be running multiple virtual machines simultaneously. ==Pods are also isolated in its own private network== unless configured. 

> [!note]- Pods & Containers
> Although K8s uses Pods as deployment unit, it is only "packaging" abstraction that for K8s to wrap around a set of containers. In the scope of Nodes, they are still individual containers.
