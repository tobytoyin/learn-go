- *Producer* (aka *Publisher*, *Sender*)
	- is the part which generates an *Record/ Event*, that contains data that describes the actual event
	- Records can come in different format but usually are small size text files like JSON or CSV + contain timestamps
- *Consumer* (aka *Subscriber*, *Recipient*)
	- is that part which process the Record(s) generated by the Producer
	- this is done in either "[[#Broker System|polling]]" records from a *subscribed topic* or "[[#Direct Messaging System|pushing]]" records by a subscribed topic
- *Topic* (aka *Stream*)
	- is a way to organise different Records in a file system
	- generally Records that capture one type of event belongs to a Topic, e.g., Sales events -> Sales Topic; Traffic events -> Traffic Topic
