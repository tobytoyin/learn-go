## Brute Force

Because [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|partitioned]] data are scattered to different machines in a cluster, one of the major challenge in requesting data is to find out ==where the data is actually being stored?==.

One way to do this is to have the client to search for all the Nodes in order to find the Node that contains the partitioned data. But this is not an ideal approach because this would need to exhaustively search for an increasing scaling number of Nodes.

## Metastores across Worker Nodes

This is called a "*Round Robin Load Balancing*" approach. This approach based on that metadata (e.g., location for each partitions) are stored at the distributed Nodes. It does this when requesting data for specific partitions: 
1. make the request to some random Data Node(s)
2. If the required partitions exist --> response back to client 
3. otherwise --> send the request to the appropriate Node(s) based on the metastore's information

## Metastore at the Master Node 

![[3_hidden/_images/zookeeper-20221122161701.png|300]]

The "*Zookeeper*" approach is when: 
- **metastore is stored and managed on a separate Node** (usually on the Master Node) and contains all the metadata on what partitions are stored in which Worker Node
- clients' requests enters to the Metastore Node and it locates the correct Worker Node that stored the required partition(s)
- handling of the request is routed to the Worker Node and the execution are completed at the Worker Node and responds back to the client

---
## Metastore in the Client

The last approach is put the metastore in the Client application while the data storage system doesn't have any information where the partitions are being stored.
