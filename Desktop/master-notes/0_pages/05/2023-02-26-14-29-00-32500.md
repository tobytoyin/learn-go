# Observer Pattern 

--- 

_Observer Design Pattern_ aims to [[💡 Design Pattern - Diagnosis by Anti-Patterns#If-else Switch Statement|refactor]] *one-to-many* objects dependency. This involves having a *Subject* which takes the initiative of generating data, and transmitting them to different *Observers* automatically.

## 🏆 Goals of Observer Pattern

In using Observer Pattern, we mainly wants to consider changes that satisfy:

- **Loose Coupling**
	- allows one Object to knows sufficient about core usage of the many other Objects (*Interface*)
	- allows ==changes in objects== but retain ==static in core logics (interaction)== 
- **Data Ownership**
	- the Subjects would contain all the detail information/ data, while Observer should know nothing about them

---
## 📖 Use Cases Traits

- **Expect lots of expandable interactions**
	- changing interactions between different applications needs to be flexible
	- foreseeing that adding more interactions would be a nightmare
- **One-to-many relationship**
	- expecting one application to interact/ communicate with many different application at once
	- expecting the interaction to be *One-way interaction* (asynchronous)
- **Focus around "Events" & "Inputs"**
	 - can easily think about the programme as having ==one event that leads to subsequent effects== (*reactive* to events)
	 - other Objects only care about Input values without knowing the details
- **Emphasise on "Automatics"**
	 - expecting codes to updates *automatically* rather than manually

## ➡️ The Push Design 

If we recognise a OOP programme ([[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800|object -> method -> outputs]]), the Observer Pattern follows a programmatic flow like this: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230426232435.png|500]]

> [!tip]- Steps
> Both Subject and Observer objects contain their own methods, to enable an automatic *updates* when Subject completes some logics: 
> - Subject contains an Interface of Observer
> - Subject `notify()` a list of Observers by calling their `update()`
> - `update()` results are return to each Observer's scope

This approach is a "*Push Approach*" that Observers are entirely passive without interacting with the Subject, while the Subject takes the initiative to pushes data into a method exposes by Observer. 

This approach allows data that stored/ generated from Subject to be presented in Observer, which can [[Linking Observer Pattern to Applications|bridge it to other application]]. 

> [!note]- UML
> Observer Pattern can be expressed as an OOP UML: 
> - Subject can add/ remove some new Observer 
> - Subject uses the Observer Interface to call its `update()`

## ⬅️ The Pull Design

Another way to implement Observer Pattern is using a "*Pull Approach*": 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230426232940.png|500]]

This approach works similarly to [[#➡️ The Push Design]] but `notify()` are just invoking the Observer to get data from the Subject instead of feeding data to Observer. 

> [!note]- UML
> As in UML, the only difference is that Observer now dependency on a particular Subject, as the Observer needs to know the Subject's `getter()` to pull value from it.
