Snowflake relies on three main Access Control methods:
- *Role-based Access Control* - Users-to-Resources Access through Roles
- *Discretionary Access Control* - Role-to-Objects Ownerships
- *Role's Access Inheritances* - Role-to-Role Access granting

## Role-based Access Control

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-07-28-11-18#^role-based-access]]

In an *Role-based Access Control* model, USER interacts with resources/ objects/ actions based on given ROLE. 
1. a Person is *identified* into a Snowflake USER
2. ROLE are given and assigned to USER
3. *Access Authorisation* provides [[0_pages/05/d-2023-07-28-12-15-02|Privileges]] to ROLE in to perform tasks 
4. USER uses/ switch to ROLE to perform tasks

A Snowflake doesn't need to create new credentials when using different Roles, they can just switch to different assigned Roles freely that are allowed to use when executing commands.

## Discretionary Access Control

*Discretionary Access Control* indicates objects' ownerships and privileges transference. 

When [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-05-18-97000|secured object]] is created in Snowflake, its **ownership and controls are managed by its object's owner Role**. This allows operations like:
- the owner Role has full privileges on the object it created
- the owner Role can *pass privileges* to other Roles to access it
- the owner Role can *transfer ownership* to other Roles to own the same object

For account objects, e.g., Users, Roles, Resources, its ownership are managed by Snowflake *System Defined Roles* (e.g., `ACCOUNTADMIN`, `USERADMIN`, etc.)

## Roles Hierarchy

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230728184946.png]]

*Roles Hierarchy* indicates a hierarchical relationship among Roles and the transfer of access & ownership based on that. Under this hierarchy tree, privileges/ ownerships are transferred in:
- *specifically granted options* - higher-privileges Roles granted additional privileges/ ownerships that are not inherited
-  *inherits from bottom to top* - higher-privileges Roles inherits all the privileges from lower-privileges Roles
- *ownership from bottom to top* - higher-privileges Roles own all the resources & roles that are inherited from lower-privileges Roles

### Access Inheritance

A higher privileged Role can grant (or create if allowed) a lower privileged Role. The lower privileged Role by default inherits all the access permissions from its parent (unless being revoked). Similarly, if any lower privileged Role granted new access permission, the higher privileged Role also implicitly get those.

### Roles Impersonation

A higher privileged Role automatically grant the usage of of all lower privileged Role. A higher privileged Role can freely switch to another lower privileged Role (as *Role Impersonation*). This is useful for higher privileged Role users to switch to another Role to test & refine access rules without creating new user account. 

### Objects Ownership & Oversight

A higher privileged Role can *oversight* and control Objects that are created by a lower privileged Roles under [[#Discretionary Access Control]]. In contrast, lower-privileged Roles cannot view objects created by higher-privileged Role.
