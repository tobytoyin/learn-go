Put it simply, a *Data Warehouse* is a collection of Databases and centralised hub for data. This reduces to complexity to bring data from different databases together for different analytics applications. With Data Warehousing, databases from different sources can bring together easily to conduct analysis, e.g., data joining & aggregation.

> [!Tip]
> Data Warehouse is mostly a relational database that is capable of:
> - running in distributed manner for scalability & fault tolerant
> - connect/ store data from various un-centralised databases

## Why Data Warehouse?

Data warehouse essentially is an [[0_pages/04/2023-03-13-21-39-49-96800|repository layer]] of the Production datasources that support specifically for analytic purposes: 
- avoid overloading production databases for analytics large read loads
- minimise analytics applications to contain transformation logics, i.e., keeping applications to mostly as a "presentation layer"
- support analytics computation

## Core Components

Although new technologies implement different data warehouses, some common components that are universal to most data warehouses: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230405212803.png]]^data-warehouse

- *Data Sources* - being the databases/ raw data from some production systems
- *Relational Database System* mainly consists of two parts: 
	- a Data Warehouse which is the storage of structured data that store data ready to be consumed by downstream applications
	- an ETL system that use SQL-like to 
		- "extract" raw data from data sources
		- apply common "transformation" of raw data
		- "load" and store them into Data Warehouse storage
- *Data Marts* - is a *functional specific layer* ("presentation" layer) that
	- extracts subset of datasets from the Data Warehouse
	- conducts additional service's specific ETL that serves specific or cross applications/ reports uses, i.e., ETL that may not be needed for other services

## Data Warehouse Variants

Some different data warehouse architecture approaches follow a similar approach by separating/ adding new components within this architecture: 

### ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) System

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230405212811.png]]

ELT systems using add additional *Staging Databases* to store the subsets of data from the source systems. This generally reduces the burden of Data Transformation Systems by: 
- allow more distributed computation working on small batches of staging data
- more fault tolerant - transformation errors only look back to Staging Databases instead of request data from source systems again

### Decoupling of Compute & Storages

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230405212859.png]]^snowflake

Cloud-first Software like [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-04-27-31600|Snowflake]] decouples a single monolith Relational Database system into Computation and Storage layers. This aims to allow **elastic scaling the computation system** based on volumes.
