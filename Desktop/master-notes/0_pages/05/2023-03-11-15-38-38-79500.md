# Scala - Functions Composition 

In simplest term, *Functions Composition* is a way to ==chain multiple functions execution along the way==, allow one the output of one function directly be the input of another function. 

This process is similar to [[0_pages/01/2023-03-11-15-34-12-98200#Functional Executions|chaining in Unix]], e.g., `echo "abc" | grep "a"`.

## Why Functions Composition

When dealing writing codes with [[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-17-29-07-77300|Pure Functions]], it is quite common to write codes in an algebraic style, e.g., `val y = h(g(f(x)))`. The more functions/ steps we put in, the more nested the codes become. 

Many OOP inherit from the same class allows chain methods. But for functions that are not extended from a class (mostly because coupling is not needed), we need to use something similar for this. 

```scala
// in OOP - methods to return self (`this`) can be used to chain
class X(var x: Int): 
    def add(num: Int): X = 
        x += num
        this

    def subtract(num: Int): X = 
        x -= num
        this 

// usage
val x = X(5)
val result = x.add(5).subtract(3)
```

`compose` & `andThen` 

Scala has two approaches to do Functions Composition: `compose` and `andThen`. Both follow the syntax of: `func1.compose(func2)(initial_input)`. 

For example: 

```scala
// To do this in FP - output -> input
val initial = (x: Int) => x
val addOne = (x: Int) => x + 1
val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => { x + y }: Int
val subtract = (x: Int, y: Int) => { x - y }: Int

// when functions are unary (i.e., output = next input), we can: 
val unaryResult = initial.compose(addOne)(5)

// functions that take arguments (i.e., output = next input + args):
val result = initial.compose(addOne)
					.compose(add(_, 5)) 
					.compose(subtract(_, 3))(5)
```

When consider our functions `f`, `g`, `h`. The difference between `compose` and `andThen` is: 
- `compose` - execute from the last function to the first, e.g., `h(g(f(x)))` 
- `andThen` - execute from the first function to the last, e.g., `f(g(h(x)))`

For example: 

```scala
val mul = (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y

val composeResult = initial.compose(addOne).compose(mul(_, 5))(5)
// > (5 * 5) + 1 = 26

val addThenResult = initial.andThen(addOne).andThen(mul(_, 5))(5)
// > (5 + 1) * 5 = 30
```
