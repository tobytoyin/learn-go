An [[0_pages/05/2023-03-12-16-55-04-34900|Singleton Class]] can be used along with [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-14-29-00-32500|Observer Pattern]]. This allows information that would change anywhere at any time within an application lifecycle to be updated easily. 

This seems to allow the observer to be retrieved anywhere within the application; and making it a stable connection to another part of the application (or even some database connections).
