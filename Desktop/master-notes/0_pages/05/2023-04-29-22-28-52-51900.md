Unlike ACID database, [[0_pages/54/d-2023-11-15-12-47-01|Object Storage]] cannot maintain "*versioning*" by using Write-Ahead-Log. This is because ObjStore by nature replace objects when the key is the same. 

To enable versioning of objects, it uses a similar approach as maintaining [[0_pages/05/2023-04-29-22-11|objects consistency]] in using a ACID database to maintain versioning information.

## Write New Version

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230429222841.png|500]]

To write a new version of the same Key object: 
1. an object with the same Key is uploaded to the client
2. the client add an additional "version" values into the Key in the background:
	- e.g., the object with Key `obj-123` is being uploaded 
	- querying the metaStore, the latest version is `v2`
	- a new Key is created as `obj-123-v3`
	- this essentially creates a new object with a different Key but is hidden from the end-user 
3. new object with the new "versioning" Key added are uploaded to the ObjStore & latest version is also updated to the metaStore

## Get Version Object

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230429224233.png|500]]

To get a versioned object (by default the "latest" version): 
1. a Key is queried to a "Read Client" 
2. in the background, the client queries the metaStore to get the latest version (or particular version) of the Key; this returns the actual Key of the "versioned" object
3. using the "versioned Key", it queries to the ObjStore
4. the "versioned object" is then returned
