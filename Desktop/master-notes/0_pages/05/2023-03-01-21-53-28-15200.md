# Selecting Number of Partitions


> [!NOTE] Notations
> For simplicity, let keep it to the following notations: 
> - `numParts` - number of partitions
> - `numNodes` - number of Nodes for storages

## Fixed Number of Partitions

The simplest way to repartitioning is based on *fixed number of partitions* and to rebalance the partitions in a system by monitoring the *Node-to-Partition Ratio*:
1.  select a fixed `numParts` at the beginning design/ setup phase
	- commonly setup **more partitions than the number of Nodes** in a system
	- which the Ratio (`numParts/numNodes`) is greater than 1
3. when `numNodes` change, rebalancing by evenly moving partition(s) from existing Node(s) to new Node(s) 
	- this can be done by comparing the Ratios 
	- i.e., `oldRatio - newRatio` is the number of partitions we want to rebalance and move into new Node(s)

> [!Example]- An Example
> Let say, we select a the Ratio to be "1-Node to 100-Partitions", i.e., every Node contains about 100 partitions:
> - if original system have `numNodes = 10`, we can fix `numParts = 1000` 
> - currently the ratio `numParts/numNodes` is `1000/10 = 100`

> When Nodes scale-up to `numNodes = 12`

> - this roughly means that every Node can move about 17 partitions to the new Nodes (`100 - 83 = 17`)

Because `numParts` is fixed, this method requires designers to foresee the range of change `numNodes` beforehand. An rule-of-thumb is that it is suitable when: 
- the storage system is quite static and doesn't need to scale often/ quickly
- having a clear maximum of Nodes the system would be using
