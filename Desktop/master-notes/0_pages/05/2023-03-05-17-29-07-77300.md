# Pure Functions 


A *Pure Function* is a function only output based on the inputs, which meet several of the following properties:

### Output only based Inputs and internal algorithm

If we input "1 + 1", a pure function can only dependent on the "1" and "+". This is contrast to OOP which a "method" could access the properties of an input object (e.g., `this.property`) and modify the outputs. 

### No Side-effects 

_No Side-effects_ means that a pure function should not interact/ reference anything of the outside world: 
- no read/ write/ print data outside of the function
- no global variable (*hidden variables*) reference
- only base on the function contents and inputs

> [!Tip]- Results are always the same
> There are no randomness or outside inference that can change the function's behaviour. This allows a function to output the same result all the time. E.g., `hash` of the same input always generate the same output.

## What Pure Function allows us to do?

### Functional Composition

With Pure function, outputs are always depending on inputs. This allows functional codes to be written in a chain (*pipe*) style:

```scala
val x = first(a).then(b).then2(c).then3(d).finally(e)
```

### Parallelise Computing

Because outputs are always depending on inputs, this makes it easy parallelise computation of many tasks. This is because we only need to break down a large chunk of inputs into many separate inputs for the pure functions; and each function doesn't need to communicate with the external world.
