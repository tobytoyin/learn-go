title: Summary - Supply Chain GNN

## Objectives
- business goal 
	- aims to **improve visibility/ responsiveness** of procurement in dealing with suppliers & supply chain
- use [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-06-30-81300|GNN]] ([[0_pages/05/GNN Convolution|GCN]]) to make link prediction: 
	- Nodes represent supplier companies and Edges represent procurement relationship 
	- predicts if there are any hidden suppliers that can substitute/ reserve current procurement
- improve interpretability in supply chain by using Graph to show information

## Subgraph Extraction

*Subgraph Extraction* is a task to extract a smaller subgraph as input graph for [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-06-30-81300|GNN]]. Embeddings within the subgraph are used for training and predict whether there are hidden links between selected nodes (**can either can be connected or not**). 

- [[n-hops neighbourhoods]] - select Nodes that needed for prediction, then creates a subgraph by extracting neighbour nodes within 1-hop of each selected Nodes

## Structural Node Colouring

[[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-17-53-61400|Structural Node Colouring]] is a "*Graph Hashing*" approach to understand the *similarity* of structure and connections among different graphs. 

By [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-15-28-13200|Hashing]] the Nodes into different colour of different graphs:
- identical graph would give the same colour hash -> 100% similarity
- more similar the graphs are, their hashed colour values would be closer

In this paper, this hashed colour are turned into one-hot encoding as GNN inputs. 

### The boundary of colour
based on the min/ max of hops defined in [[#Subgraph Extraction]], the minimum of shortest path is $n$ hops and maximum is $2n$ hops. This gives the maximum distance $3n$.

##  Model Explainability

[[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-19-04-75000|IG]]

---
## Training Process
1. select 2 Nodes
2. generate subgraph
3. create embedding
4. feedforward

## Other Models 

[[Preferential Attachment]]

---
## Critics
- Inputs are just [[#Structural Node Colouring|encoded colour]], so it is lacking on key information/ metrics about the suppliers
- "linked" edge is only based on 1 hop neighbour (max 2 distances) which the graph might be relatively small
