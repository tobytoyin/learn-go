# K8s Deployment Example 

In this walkthrough, I will break down each section of a [[0_pages/01/2023-03-11-15-36-13-23200|K8s YAML]] for a new nginx web server [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-09-12-28000|deployment]]: 

---
## Objectives

This YAML has __ objectives: 
1. Create 3 Pods of `nginx` server and each exposes its [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|virtual port]] 80
2. Create a label


---
## YAML

The first section of this [[0_pages/01/2023-03-11-15-36-13-23200#Manifest|manifest]] defines this API call as a "Deployment" action. It creates a `labels`, which serves as a tag to group this manifest under `app: nginx`. 

```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
	name: nginx-deployment
	labels: 
		app: nginx
```

The second section defines the Specification of this deployment, which: 
- create 3 replicas of the `nginx` Pod
- create a `selector` of `labels` to [[0_pages/02/2023-03-05-17-29-30-36500#LabelSelector in ReplicaSet|reference Pods specification when replicate]]
- `template` defines the [[0_pages/02/2023-03-05-17-29-30-36500|ReplicaSet]] of the `nginx` Pod 

```yml
spec: 
	replicas: 3
	selector: 
		matchLabels: 
			app: nginx
	template:
		...
		...
```

The nested section within the `template` defines the Pod ReplicaSet details: 
- `labels` matches the `selector.matchLabels` so that it can be replicated
- list of `containers` as in this Pod

```yml
# continue from `template`
	template:
		# below are the spec of Pod, which is 
		# the ReplicaSet config for deployment
		metadata:
			labels: 
				app: nginx
		spec:
			containers:
			- name: nginx
			  image: nginx:1.14.2
			  ports: 
			  - containerPort: 80
```
