## Query Type

While a Data Object Schema defines the abstract relationship between data, a *Query Type Schema* mainly abstractly describe: 
- what endpoints can be used
- what parameters are accepted by each Endpoint
- what [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-19-16-10-50|Object Type]]/ Values are returned from each Endpoint

> [!Tip] 
> A "Query" endpoint in GraphQL is similar to the GET endpoints in REST. Both are responsible for fetching data. But in GraphQL, there are only one entrypoint by exposing different Query's Fields as endpoints.

The above data fetching structure can be converted in the Query Schema as: 

```graphql
type Query {
	# below are the different endpoints
	getAllPerson: [ Person ] 
	getByFirstName(firstName: String!): [ Person ]
}
```

In this `Query` schema, we have: 
- `getAllPerson` endpoint returns list of `Person` object
- `getByFirstName` endpoint returns list of `Person` based on an required `firstName`
