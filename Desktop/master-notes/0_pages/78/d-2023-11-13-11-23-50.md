## AZ Login

To allow Terraform to create resources, we need to create credential by using `az login` , see [[0_pages/78/d-2023-11-13-11-40-16|Azure Login]] for steps.

## VM Components and Terraform

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231114113920.png]]

- *Resource Group* - resource group is need to deploy a Terraform stack to allocate related resource into the same deployment group
- *Virtual Network* - VNet provides a network boundary for our VM, this allows resources within the VNet to access by network connections
- *Subnet* - attaches to VNet and provides a finer network layer for the VM
- *Network Interface* - attaches to the Subnet, which provides private & public IP address to the Subnet for network connections
- *Public IP* - provides a static IP to a running VM, such that we can connect to a specific VM by IP address (dynamically rotate when VM is stopped)
- *Security Group* - act as a firewall and network control layer, this specifies what kinds of network connections are allowed to connect into the VM's. This binds to a Network Interface and serves as a network control. 
- *VM* - is the actual compute instance, we need to specify several things for this to work: 
	- OS Disk - the "hard disk" for the VM
	- Source Image - the image a VM to start up on
	- Network Interface - an attached network interface to allow VM to have network activities
	- username, hostname, password - to allow user SSH access

## Terraform

```shell
terraform init -upgrade  # install providers
terraform plan -out main.tfplan # to dry run the plan
terraform apply main.tfplan
```
