In one of the use case, I have an [[0_pages/01/d-2023-09-19-10-25-11|interface]] (`Protocol`) that needs to have a Generic typing in order to maintain a collection of Functions. 

These functions are being used and implement a generic interface by different `Provider` that could lives in external system. While the package/ application contains a `Adapter` that would [[wip/d-2023-09-18-22-13-28|convert]] the output from `Providers` into valid class object.

## Top Level Generic Interface

The top level generic interface `Protocol[T, R]` is used to maintain what kind of functions is required, both `Provider` and `Adapter` would need to implement them to maintain the contract. 

```python
from typing import Protocol, TypeVar, runtime_checkable

T = TypeVar("T", contravariant=True)  # input type
R = TypeVar("R", covariant=True)  # return type

class FunCollection(Protocol[T, R]):
	@staticmethod
	def func_a(_: T) -> R: ...
	
```

## Provider & Adapter Interface

`Provider` and `Adapter` maintains an interface that specifies the generic typing: 

```python
# ./provider/interface.py

@runtime_checkable
class Provider(FunCollection[str, dict], Protocol)
	@staticmethod
	def func_a(_: str) -> dict: ...

```

```python
# ./adapter/interface.py

@runtime_checkable
class Adapter(FunCollection[dict, MyClass], Protocol)
	@staticmethod
	def func_a(_: dict) -> MyClass: 
		# adpater conversion logics
		...

```

## Type Checking on Provider's Implementation

As `Provider` can implement their own packages from external resources, e.g., they can implement it in the cloud, as custom packages, and relies only on some `process` to pass down their results as a payload JSON. Our `process` needs to check if the interface is correct: 

```python
# ./process.py

def some_process(provider: ConcreteProvider):
	if not issubclass(provider, Provider):
		raise ImplementationError
	
	return provider
```
