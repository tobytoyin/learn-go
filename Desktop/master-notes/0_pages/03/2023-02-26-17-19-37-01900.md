# Optimising Skewed Partitioning 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230110213711.png|400]]

Partitions are [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600#Skewed|skewed]] when some Executors need to work on more data, i.e., larger partition than the others. This usually means that other Executors are bottlenecked by certain skewed Executors.  ^skewed-partition

This usually happens when a [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-14-52-55-14900|group-by operations lead to some hot keys]] so that those grouped data are partitioned into a very large RDD.

## Treatments 

Before Joins/ Aggregations: 
- increase the number of partitions (`repartition`) 
- include additional repartition columns to [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-14-52-55-14900#Shared Joins/ Group By|break one skewed partition into multiple shared partitions]]
- use filters and select to discard data that won't be used upfront, this reduce skewed partition at later stage
- compute some common statistics beforehand

During Joins/ Aggregations: 
As a high level API, there isn't much we can directly do there: 
- try grouping at a finer granularity (more partitions) and subsequently grouping into a larger group
- if we know well that some [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-16-59-62600|group-by/ join strategies]] are better, we can [hint](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-performance-tuning.html#join-strategy-hints-for-sql-queries) Spark to use it to prioritise the automatically determine one
