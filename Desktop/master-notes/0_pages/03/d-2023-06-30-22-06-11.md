## Concurrency 

Unlike [[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-01-16-25-04|Sequential Programme Execution]], *Concurrency* emphasises on putting Functions (as *Coroutines*, or Background Tasks) into the Stack of other Threads. These Coroutines are only queued but not execute until the Processor frees up the current running Thread to another Thread. 

> [!Tip]
> Concurrency is about "doing multiple computation at the same time" by using available resources.

## Time Slicing Concurrency

*Time Slicing* - the processor automatically switching among Threads to allow each Threads make mini-progress of its work

## Thread Blocking

*Thread Blocking* - explicitly introduce a pause on the Main Thread, thus putting the Thread's state as "BLOCKED" and switch to work on other Threads

In real application, Thread Blocking is usually determine by the programming languages on getting the state of a Thread (e.g., ALIVE, BLOCKED, etc.). This can be introduced into the programme by using: 
- Concurrent Sleep (thread freeing sleep)
- Scan for user inputs

## Concurrency vs Sequential Executions

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230702101740.png]]

In a Sequential Single-Threaded Programme, all Functions are executed in sequential order, even one particular Function is just waiting and not computing anything. 

In a Concurrent Programme, Functions that can be executed independently can be queued as Coroutines in other Threads. When a particular Function is BLOCKED (e.g., waiting on external resources, putting to sleep), the Processor temporarily switches to other Threads and work on those Coroutines.
