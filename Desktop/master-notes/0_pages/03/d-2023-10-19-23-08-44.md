A *Meta Field* in GraphQL refers to the "Type Name" of an Object. For example: 

```graphql
type Employee {
	name: String!
}

# this contains the metafield "Employee"
```

To extract this Type Name when returning the result, we can use `__typename`: 

```graphql
{
	getEmployees {
		__typename
		name
	}
}
```
