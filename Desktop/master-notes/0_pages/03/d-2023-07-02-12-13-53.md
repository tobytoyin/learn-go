## Out-of-Sync Problem

A generic Variable in Go is meant for synchronised ordered execution, i.e., one Function modifies/ outputs an variable; another Function references it. 

However, [[0_pages/03/d-2023-06-30-22-06-11|Concurrency execution]] doesn't guarantee synchronised execution. For example: Goroutines took longer than expected to finished; Goroutines queued ahead multiple times.

This means the programme will have *out-of-sync problem* when relying on [[0_pages/02/2023-04-10-16-06-41-06100|Pointer]]. For example: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230702125451.png]]

-  `go ping(&ptr)` has completed the 2nd time but `go print(&ptr)` is out-of-sync. Causing the 1st execution of `go print` referencing the 2nd mutated value
- `go ping(&ptr)` has completed only once but `go print(&ptr)` is out-of-sync by running 2nd time. Causing the 2nd execution of `go print` referencing the 1st mutated value (lag behind)

## chan Type

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230702162007.png]]

The Go implementation of *message-passing concurrency* is a *Channel* Variable. This aims to handle this problem and make sure the **Goroutines are blocked until executions are synchronised**, i.e., concurrent execution & await for synchronised result (similar to [[0_pages/03/d-2023-09-24-11-06-27|Async Await]]). 

> [!Tip]- `chan` Variable
> A Channel typed variable `chan <type>` is embedded onto another Type: 
> - `chan string` - a `string` variable that is also channel
> - `chan myStruct` - a `struct` variable that is also channel
> - `chan []float64` - a channel variable that contains an array of `float64`

```go
func pinger(channel chan string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		// send message to a channel's variable
		channel <- strconv.Itoa(i)  
		
		fmt.Printf("ping(%d)\n", i)		
	}
}

func printer(channel chan string) {
	for {
		// receive message from a channel's variable
		value := <- channel
		
		fmt.Printf("ref(%s)\n", value)
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	}
}

func main() {
	// this sync the goroutines by: 
	// pinger -> printer, pinger -> printer
	var channel chan string = make(chan string)

	go pinger(channel)
	go printer(channel)
	
	fmt.Scanln()
}
```

## Lifecycle of a Channel

A lifecycle of a Channel between two Goroutines is completed when:
- a message is send to a channel from Goroutines `channel <- sendVar`
- a message is received from a channel `receiveVar := <- channel`

Because of this, if we introduce a new Goroutine that use the channel variable, we would end up having 2 separate channels with the same variable:

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230702162020.png]]

```go 
func main() {	
	var channel chan string = make(chan string)
	
	// this sync the goroutines by: 
	// 1) pinger -> printer, pinger -> printer 
	// 2) ponger -> printer, ponger -> printer

	go pinger(channel)  // sender 
	go ponger(channel)  // sender
	go printer(channel) // receiver
	
	fmt.Scanln()
}
```

## Channel Direction & Signature

By using `chan` in a Function, its [[0_pages/03/2023-03-20-12-19-29-31000|functional signature]] is unclear whether it is sending/ receiving messages in a Channel. This can be improved by using a *channel direction* as function signature:
- `func(c chan<- Type)` - accepts channel as a Sender Function
- `func(c <-chan Type)` - accepts channel as a Receiver Function
