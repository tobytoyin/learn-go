In design data application, it can be commonly categorised into three different types of system: 
- Online System
- Batch Processing System
- Stream Processing System

An *Online System (Service)* is common for applications which uses a Client to receive small amount of inputs (usually in a form of payload) as requests. The Process needs to handle the requests inputs as efficient as possible to return results (response) back to the Client. 

The key performance of this type of system lies on the entire response handling speed (red line).
