# Isolation 

"*Isolation*" handles the two concurrency issues during read or writes of the same records by making different Transactions isolated from other on-going Transactions, i.e., without knowing what other Transactions are modifying. ^14cdf8

> "dirty read" - is when reading partial data when concurrently writing the same
> "dirty write" - is when writing the same data concurrently

## Read Isolation

Isolation in read is archived by ==not showing partial/ uncommitted Transaction records==. This means that the records from a read query only shows either committed Transaction or not seeing them at all.

## Write Isolation

When having concurrent writes in database, there are two approach in handling it: 

> [!example]- Serialisation
> Instead of modifying the same records simultaneously, each Transaction are isolated as serial of commits one after another (sorted by transaction start time). 
> This makes accessing the same records as sequentially access it after the prior Transactions are done.
