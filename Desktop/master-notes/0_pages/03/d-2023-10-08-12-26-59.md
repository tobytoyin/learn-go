When a Kafka Producer streams a Topic message to a Kafka Broker, messages are distributed and stored by [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|Partitions]]: 
- Topic handlers are distributed across multiple Brokers 
- each Broker and *partitioned Topics* are severed as a central hub on how to distribute the Consumers' subscription and Brokers' storages

## Producer Topics to Partitioner

When Producers stream Messages to a one of the Topic's Broker, message would be partitioned and store within the Broker. New Messages are stacked in the *partitioned Topic queue* and incremented by an *offset ID* to maintain the streaming order. 
Partitioning during Topics ingestion allows minimal [[0_pages/05/2023-03-01-21-32-42-34200|data shuffling]] and allow Consumers to read data with minimal overheads. 

Kafka by default use [[d-2023-07-12-23-34-41|Consistent Hashing]] to randomly distribute Messages to a random partition within a Topic. Partitioning can also be done by using a "key" defined in the message and distributing them.

## Partitioned Topic to Consumer

To assign a Message publisher for Kafka Consumers, Kafka distributes the pub-sub workloads by assigning the partitioned Topic queues to Consumers randomly. In essential when a Consumer subscribes Messages from a Topic, it is **subscribing to the assigned partitions of a Topic**.

## Partitioned Topic to Storages

Kafka Brokers is maintained as a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-33-82100|Distributed Storage]] to store Messages and metadata. Messages and metadata are stored in distribution based on their partitions.
