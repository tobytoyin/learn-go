## Separation of Layers

When architecting a business system, it is common to have 3 main layers:

- *Service Layer* to interact/ present results of the business logics to different applications & services
- *Domain Layer* to model how a business (domain) process should work as a standalone system
- *Storage Layer* to store the data and interact with Databases

### Architectural Dependency

- *Layered Architecture* - the layers of the system are dependent on one layer. 
	- e.g. Service Layer (e.g. API) depending on the Domain Layer's logics
	- Domain Layer's logics dependent on database's [[Data Models]] (i.e., ORM)
- *Onion Architecture* ([[0_pages/02/d-2023-09-28-21-26-45|Dependency Inversion]]) - is the ideal approach in creating domain model system. **Dependencies are "inverted"** to the Domain Layer, making it the base and centre of the system, e.g.;
	- Domain Layers lives on its own - making Domain Layer only care about executing logics correctly without knowing the details of other layers
	- Domain Layers only knows about the Abstractions of other layers to facilitate getting or writing data to other layer
	- Technologies Layers (databases, services, presentations) are dependent on the Domain Layers' results and data structure; changing technologies/ frameworks won't affect Domain Layers, as long as it can connect to it
	- Domain Layer easily testable, i.e., given some data, test if the logics are correct

## Domain Model

A *Domain Model* is 
- a way to use system to replicate how some existing business processes (more generally *domain processes*) work
- these processes generally is working process in the real world  ^39b05f

Because domain knowledge, practices, and processes often change; a Domain Model's system would need to be changed flexibly on its own.

A system of Domain Model can be: 
- highly coupled within different components of the Domain
- can be both good/ poor processes
- lots of Domain-based properties, facts, and assumptions
- etc.....

However a good architecture should be indifference of how complex/ simple; good/ bad the domain process works. The technical details of a system's backend architecture should be hidden from how the domain logics are being defined. 

This makes it possible to: 
- change/ test/ implement new processes within the scope of the Domain Layer
- allow domain experts to express & create new processes [[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-22-18-04-44600|using their own languages]]
- change/ swap to different technologies to support the Domain Model without affecting it
