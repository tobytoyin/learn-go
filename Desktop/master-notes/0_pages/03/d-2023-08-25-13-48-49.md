## Unit of Work

An *Unit of Work* (UoW) refers to a single atomic operation when interacting with a connection (usually a database):
- interacting with a database as a [[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-17-26-33-08300|single transaction]]
- a connection (session) with database that can commit/ rollback
- a set of operations for a single Service's request (data integrity/ validation)

‚úÖ An UoW is useful in design systems because it makes protocols: 
- **easy to reason about** - what separate service functions to perform in order to complete one task, i.e., as API endpoint
- **reduce API coupling** - only Services Layer is interacting with database

## ‚ùå Non-Unit of Work Layer

System without abstracting UoW usually requires the [[0_pages/04/d-2023-05-30-22-13-00-635|API Gateway]] to **make two different backend requests**: 
- one to the Service Layer for the actual functional logics
- another to the Repository Layer to access Storage (usually for pre-validation)

This design is risky because: 
- out of sync might happen causing Service "completed" but database not updated, e.g., concurrent read/ write
- lack of single protocol to mark a request as completed/ failed

## Unit of Work Layer

*Abstracting UoW Layer* mainly aims to: 
- **grouped logical protocol** for a single request into one UoW, making it easy to commit/ rollback tasks
- reduce API's responsibility - only Service Layers orchestrate tasks and interact with Databases
- simplify testing 
	- only need one mock connection in Service Layer and API is not concerned
	- can mock the orchestration without using actually connect to databases

## Pseudo-Codes

A UoW Abstraction (UoW Orchestration) can be implemented using [[0_pages/01/2023-05-02-22-32-18-90200|Context Manager]], the class generally doesn't contain any important logics, mainly: 
- session manager to group orchestration tasks
- logging implementation into one log group

```python

class UOWAbstraction:
	# context manager to ensure session handling
	# this interacts with storage with repository layer
	...

	def commit(self):
		# commit transaction DB when sucess
		...

	def rollback(self):
		# roll back transaction DB when fail
		...
```

Services functions are extended by by accepting UoW classes to group Tasks:
```python
def service_func(uow: UOWAbstraction, **kwargs):
	with uow:
		# service orchestration logics
		...

		uow.commit()  # mark as task success
```

Your API Entry point would generally look like: 
```python

uow = UoWFactory('mock')  # create a prod/ mock UoW

@app.route('/endpoint')
def endpoint_handler(**params):
	param_validate(params)
	service_func(uow, params)

	return res
```
