There are two kinds of "Variables Definitions" in a [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-20-21-24-33|Github Actions]] YAML Spec: 
- *Variables* - constant string values referenced
- *Matrix Strategy* - variational combinations of string values to spawn different builds

---
## Variables

Variables can be defined in multiple contexts and some are provided by the context created when running the workflow, e.g.: 

| Type | Context | Context |  
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Github Variable | `github` | within workflow's spec & container env var | 
| Worflow Variable | `env` | within workflow's spec & container env var | 
| Job Variable | `jobs.<jobId>.env` | within the same `jobId` as container env var | 
| Runner Variable | `jobs.<jobId>.<stepId>.env` | within the same step as container env var | 


For example: 

```yml
env:
	WORKFLOW: "my-workflow"

jobs:
	example_job:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    env:
		    JOB: "my-job"
      
	    steps:
	      - name: "1st step in ${{ env.WORKFLOW }}"
		    env: 
				RUNNER: "my-container"
	        run: |
				echo "$WORKFLOW - $JOB - $RUNNER"
```

- Workflow Variables can be referenced throughout the YAML Spec using `${{ env.VAR }}`, as well as within the runner environment `$VAR`
- other types of variables can only been referenced within the runner environment

---
## Matrix Strategy

When variables are defined under `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix`, Github Actions will generate multiple Jobs combination based on the "combination matrix" that is later referenced in `steps`. For example: 

```yaml
...

jobs:
	<job_id>:
	strategy:
		matrix:
			# <variables>: [ ... ] 
			version: [1.0, 1.1, 1.5]
			os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

When the Job's Steps are being run, this will create a 6 different Jobs, e.g.: 
- `version=1.0, os=ubuntu-latest`, `version=1.1, os=ubuntu-latest`, ...
- `version=1.0, os=windows-latest`, `version=1., os=windows-latest`, ..
