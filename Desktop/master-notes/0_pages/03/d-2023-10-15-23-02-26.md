*Ambassador Proxy* is an design approach to proxy egress traffics, i.e., listening to one web request and **translate the same request to an different network destination**.

In this example, we have: 
1. external Pod with a [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|Network]] that listen to requests at `svc:8081`
2. an App container that send Requests to `localhost:8080` only (thus cannot request to the external Pod)
3. an Ambassador to proxy request from `localhost:8080` to `svc:8081`, allow it make request to the external Pod indirectly

## Advantage in Mocking

One advantage in using this design approach is in developing Microservice APIs: 
- network configuration on the `App` container can be minimised, e.g., hardcode to 8080
- request to the `Mock` API host can be attached to `localhost:8080`
- request to the `Prod` API host can be proxy via the Ambassador

This benefits in **minimising codes and configuration changes** with regards to which port should be requested to.
