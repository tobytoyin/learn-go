# Spark Dataflow Engine 
   

Spark works quite similar to traditional [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|MapReduce]] but with different terminology: 


- Action Stage - is similar to Reduce Stage, which focuses on gathering all the data

Althought both Action Stage in Spark and Reduce Stage in MapReduce both gather all data into a partition, the major difference is that Spark doesn't implicitly write these output into the harddrive but they are kept in-memory

## Transformations

Spark *Transformation* is similar to MapReduce's [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|Mapping Stage]], which only applies a record-wise mapper function. Transformations are *lazily evaluated*, i.e., the computation is only stored as a *Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)* plan and not physically available until [[#Actions]] are taken.

### Transformation vs Mapping

One major difference between Spark and MapReduce approach to mapping is the scope of which the mapper function applies on, i.e., Spark applies function on the entire partition whereas MapReduce applies it on a single Record.  

| Method | Parallelism | Machine Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MapReduce | on a single Record | Fit across multiple machines | 
| Spark | on a single Partition | Fit in a single machine |

The reason is that Spark has a restriction that ==the entire partition needs to fit into in-memory storage==, making the entire partition utilised in a single machine (if a machine has lots of in-memory storage, it can store more partitions). 

Whereas MapReduce doesn't have this restriction, allowing the partition's records spread among multiple machines. 

This difference allows Spark to *map partitions in parallel*, while MapReduce can only map records in parallel.
