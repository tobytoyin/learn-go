# Higher Order Functions 

Essentially a *Higher Order Function* (HOF) is a way of how algebra works in [[0_pages/02/d-2023-09-27-12-14-03|Functional Programming]]. For example: 


This kind of expression makes both `h()` and `g()` HOFs. More formally: 
> HOF - A function that takes other functions as parameters, or whose result is a function.

## Functional Signature

A *Functional Signature* is a type hinting of what the function looks: 

```scala
val plusOne = (x: Int) => ( x + 1 ): Int
val plusTwoNums = (x: Int, y: Int) => ( x + y ): Int

val num = List(1, 2, 3)
val strNum = List("1", "2", "3")

num.map(plusOne)  // signature indicates usable
strNum.map(plusOne)  // signature indicates not-usable
```

Using `plusOne` as an example, a Signature comprises of two components:
- Inputs Types - `(x: Int)` indicates `x`  is of `Int` type
- Outputs Types - `( x + 1 ): Int` indicates the output is also of `Int` type

The Functional Signature of this function is - `(Int) => (Int)` ; and `plusTwoNums` has a signature - `(Int, Int) => (Int)`

## HOF Functional Signature

When HOF takes in another function as input, it needs to ensure that the function pass-in are usable. The functional Signature represents the type what the function HOF expects and can use it properly.

For example: 
- `mapThenPrint` HOF that execute the input function on `List[Int]`
- expected the function input `Int` and return `Int`, with a signature of `(Int) => Int`
```scala
// these are expected functions, with signature: 
// (Int) => Int
val plusOne = (x: Int) => x + 1
val minusOne = (x: Int) => x - 1

// the HOF is typed as:
def mapThenPrint(
	func: (Int) => Int,   // the signature
	listNums: List[Int]): Unit =
	
	for (i <- listNums) println(func(i))
```
