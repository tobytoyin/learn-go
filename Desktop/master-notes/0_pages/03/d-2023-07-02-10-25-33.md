## Asynchronous Programme

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230924113450.png]]

An *Asynchronous Programme* represents a programme that "no need to synchronised" on Functions' completions. This implies a "*start and move on*" mechanism in invoking functions. 

Simply saying, an **async function is only responsible in triggering a function without checking for its completion**. This is usually done in two ways: 
- outside of runtime - async uses of external process (e.g., *daemons*, api requests). This triggers the work to be done in external resources and move on to next work
- inside of runtime - async offload the work to other non-main threads and move on to the next work 

> [!NOTE]- Examples
> For example, using async functions to start OS background tasks; writing/ uploading files using background daemons; starting a remote/ cloud tasks. These tasks are based on resources outside of the programme and tracking their completion is not necessary.
