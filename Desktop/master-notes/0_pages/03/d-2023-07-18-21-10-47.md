Instead of manually [[0_pages/02/2023-03-05-17-29-30-36500#Scaling Pods|scaling up Pods]] by choosing when and how many Pods to scale, an *Autoscaler* can automatically scale the cluster's Pods based on certain metrics.

*HorizontalPodAutoscaler* aims to scale the number of Pods based on the same amount of resources (CPU, RAM) available in the cluster. This is a process of *horizontal scaling*, which "scales in/ out" more processes under the same computation resources.

## How does it work?

HorizontalPodAutoscaler mainly scales based on the use of *Metrics* and compare it with the *Desired Metric State*. When the detected Metrics values surpass the threshold of the desired metrics value, it uses a [basic algorithm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details) to determines how many [[0_pages/02/2023-03-05-17-29-30-36500|ReplicaSet]] needs to be scaled.

Generally the autoscaling process is like this: 
1. [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300|controller]] querying each Pod's for its metrics (aggregated/ custom) by some time interval
2. information are passed to HorizontalAutoscaler, mainly processes: 
	- whether the Pod's metrics (`currentMatricValue`) surpasses the `desiredMetricValue` or not, to determine if scaling is required
	- if scaling is required, determines how many replicas is required
3. Scaling Operations is passed to [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-09-12-28000|deployment]] to scale the required number of [[0_pages/02/2023-03-05-17-29-30-36500|ReplicaSet]], this creates new Pods/ Services in our cluster
