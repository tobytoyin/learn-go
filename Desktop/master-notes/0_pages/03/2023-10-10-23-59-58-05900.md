## Motivation Example

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230919213532.png]]

When types are inherited (*subtyping*), a class that [[0_pages/05/d-2023-09-16-16-01-53|dependent]] on different types has a choice to make. Let say `Client` has an interface that access to `Sellable` typed objects. There are several design choices, should `Client` dependent on:
- only with `Sellable` type?
- including types that `Sellable` is inherited from, i.e., `[Sellable, Item]`?
- including types that are extended from `Sellable`, i.e., `[Sellable, Book, Computers]`?

## Type Variances

*Type Variance* indicates the typing inheritance boundary a class can when compiled by the Scala compiler, i.e., what kind of subtypings are allowed. There are three types: 
- *Invariant* - typing limits to the same type (neither subtypes or inherited types) 
- *Covariance* - typing extends to all the types it **inherits from**
- *Contravariance* - typing limits to all subtypes it **extends to**

An simpler way to understand is to base on the "*subtyping directions*" in a UML graph when deciding which variance is suitable.

## Invariant

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230919215547.png]]

Invariant Generics are indicated by `Invar[T]`, this indicates a class will accept only objects that share the same type. For example: 

```scala
// assume we have a Array like `Container[T]`
class Container[T]

val container = Container[B2]()

container.add(B2())  // same type, ok!

container.add(A())   // not the same, not ok!
container.add(C1())  // not the same, not ok!
```

---
## Covariance

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230919222652.png]]

Covariance Generics are indicated by `Cov[+T]`, this indicates a class accepts objects with the same type and types it inherited from (*upward lineage*). For example: 

```scala
// assume we have a Array like `Container[+T]`
class Container[+T]

val container = Container[B2]()

container.add(B2())  // same type, ok!
container.add(A())   // B2 inherits A, ok!

container.add(B1())  // B1 is not upward lineage, not ok!
container.add(C1())  // C1 is downward lineage, not ok!
```

---
## Contravariance

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230919222946.png]]

Contravariance Generics are indicated by `Con[-T]`, this indicates a class accepts objects with the same type and types it extends to (*downward lineage*). For example:  

```scala
// assume we have a Array like `Container[-T]`
class Container[-T]

val container = Container[B2]()

container.add(B2())  // same type, ok!
container.add(C1())  
container.add(C2())  // C1 & C2 are extended from B2, ok!

container.add(A())   // A is upward lineage, not ok!
container.add(B1())  // B1 is not downward lineage, not ok!
```
