The goal of *Decorator Pattern* is to: 
- keep most of the code structure static but allows users to construct new mixtures of components by wrapping existing codes
- introduce new responsibilities **"on-top" or "after" existing functionalities**

> [!tip]- Lego & Decorators
> This design pattern is similar to Lego building: 
> Every Lego blocks are statically the same but allows players to construct them in different way to build stuffs.

## Goal of Decorator Patterns

- *Vary in Logics* - expects constant changes in code's functionalities
- *avoid class explosion* - having too many different class with their own methods
- *Open for Extension* - aim at adding tiny pieces of features (*open for extension*), rather than complicating existing one (*close from modification*)
- *flexibility for customisation* - let future development to add more new classes but following the same foundation

---
## 📖 Use Cases Traits

- **Lots of new/ unknown combinations**
	- expects to have some core components and different combinations are derived from them
	- foresee that code are reused/ changes in different ways by customisation/ adding more new classes
- **Extension of Functionality for just a few** 
	- we might have lots of new combinations, functionality, context variables
	- but new functionalities might only used by a few (i.e., *forward-compatible*)
- **Same kind of Foundation(s)**
	- even with lots of combinations, then foundation is still the same
	- e.g., many different types of columns but still a table; many different beverages but still based on coffee beans, etc...
- Consistent Interface, different processes
	- aims to allow different Decorated classes to use the same interface
	- but have different pre/ post logics while invoking the interface

## Decorators

The main principles in Decorators Pattern are:
- ***Object Wrapping*** 
	- allowing Object to take in other Object of the same type (i.e., the same abstract class)
	- Wrap around the *Base Class*, which the foundation; then wrap around with different *Decorator Class*, which are the customised classes
- ***Object Interface*** 
	- all the Objects wrapped contains a unified method to call (*interfaced method*)
	- this allows each Object knowing how to interacting with Object it wrapped
	- and also added capability to implement their own logics
- ***Recursive Calling*** 
	- because all Objects wrapped the same Interface, they can recursively calling the same method from the outer layer to the inner layer

> [!tip]- Steps
> - define a *Base Object* that don't take any Object (the most fundamental type)
> - define a *Decorator Object* that take in another Object (the combinations)
> - wrap another Object of the same class iteratively (C -> B -> A)
> - Since all of these objects belong to the same class, they all contain the same method (`logic`) as interface
> - (Optional) each Decorator can implement additional functionalities by adding more methods before `logic` is invoked
> - As decorated on top of each object, when the final object C method is executed, it would recursively executes the method it wrapped

>[!note]- UML
>A common way to express Decorator Pattern in UML: 
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230105232032.png|400]]
> This indicates that: 
> - Both the Base Object and other Decorators are all `Component` type
> - Decorators contains an Interface to the "Component", which accept all kinds of Object as long as it is a `Component`, this allows the wrapping of both other Decorators and Base Objects
> - All these Objects contain `mainMethod()` as Interface so that execute can chain recursively
