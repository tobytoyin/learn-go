The goal of *Facade Pattern* is to: 
- create a unified "control gateway" to interact with all the subsystem components  
- simply the interactions with multiple subsystems into a single simple method

## Design

A Facade Pattern design is simple: 
- a `FacadeClass` that composite all the other subsystem objects
- define class method on the logics that interacts with all those subsystem objects

## Principle of Least Knowledge

The *principle of least knowledge* in designing a Facade indicates a simple rule:

- interact with composite classes directly and don't interact with returned objects
![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-24-22-35#^chaining]]

We should avoid using method chaining on the returned objects when interacting with subsystem. This **reduce the traceability on what subsystem it is directly involved**.

## Facade Layers 

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-24-22-35#^layering]]

When a Facade is compositing too many objects, it would be better to: 
- create another Facade to composite another set of subsystems
- composite a Facade with another Facade, and interact with its interface
