*Value Object* is a domain object that unique identifies itself by the data it stores. This is usually defined by a hash of the data that we need to check for equality.

## Defining Value Object

In Python, unique value object can be defined by explicitly implementing:
- `__eq__(self, other)` - logics to differentiate one Value Object from another
- `__hash__(self)` - implicit ID by [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-17-15-28-13200|Hash Code]] to represent unique object

```python
@dataclass
class ValueObject:
	ref: str 
	name: str
	amt: int

	# assuming we use both ref ID
	def __eq__(self, other: ValueObject):
		if not isinstance(other, ValueObject):
			return False
		return self.ref == other.ref

	def __hash__(self):
		return hash(self.ref)
```
