# Scala Generic Typing 

*Generic Typing* is a way to allow Classes to **accept Types as parameters**. There are several reasons we might want this:
- serve as a "*type placeholder*" for the compiler to retain Types relationship
	- because a Class mainly implements core functionality but doesn't concern/ know what Types of objects will be using it
- create data structure (*collection class*) to subclassing different Type during runtime

The main reason *Generic Classes/ Traits* are used is because: 

- i.e., "whatever Type you provide into a class, it would operate the same way"
- difficult to foresee/ include all Types a class can support

> [!Example]- Common Typings - List & Map
> For example, both `List[A]` and `Map[K, V]` are Generic classes which their Type can be defined later. This is because this both List & Map can be used in a general sense regardless of Types: 
> ```scala
> // defines a list of string during runtime
> var someStringList: List[String] = Nil
> 
> // defines a hash map with String key and Any value
> var someHashMap: Map[String, Any] = Map.empty[String, Any]
> ```

## Example 

In this example, we create a `Library` Class, which like all libraries to collect different types of items. In a general sense, a `Library` is a Generic Class because it doesn't need to know what collections it is storing. This allows us to make this library being a library for books (`Library[Book]`) or a library for movies (`Library[Movie]`): 


> [!Tip]- Generic Types & Interface
> Generally, the `Library` would expect both `Book` and `Movie` extends from a common interface, such that `Library` can have a common usages on how to use the generic types.


```scala
// define our own generic class 
class Library[A]:
    // a Library class, that can be used to store [A] any Types of stuff
    
    private var collections: Map[String, A] = Map.empty[String, A]

    def put(item_id: String, item: A): Unit = 
        // put an item into the Library with an item_id
        collections += (item_id -> item)

    def get(item_id: String): A = 
        // get an item from the Library by an item_id
        collections(item_id)

    def getCollections(): Map[String, A] = 
        collections
```

To use this library, we still define what kinds of library this would be within other part of the application: 

```scala
@main def main(): Unit = 
    // we can put books into a Library of Book (Library[Book])
    val booksLibrary = Library[Book]()

    object HarryPotter extends Book:
        override def title: String = "Harry Potter"
        override def isbn: String = "000000"

    // put a book inside the book library
    booksLibrary.put(HarryPotter.isbn, HarryPotter)
    println(booksLibrary.getCollections())
    // > Map(000000 -> genericTypes$package$HarryPotter$2$@190bf8e4)
```
