## Partition Distributions

Determining the right [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|partitioning index]] is challenging, mainly because having too much/ too little partitions both lead to inefficient storage/ computation. 

An *efficient partitioning* generally is about finding the right distribution of the partitions, i.e., not too skewed and not too spread.

## Spread

When partitions are too *spread* and having too many small partitions. It would lead to two major problem: 
- *reader inefficiency* 
	- readers need to search through more partitions to find all relevant data 
- *writer inefficiency* 
	- writers need to wait longer for more partitions to transmit the data
	- creates more overheads to handle more writes from partitions

This kind of problem is mainly due to partitioning data too randomly (i.e., random index) and causing data that could be queried together to be isolated (==imagine having to buy different pasta but need to visit many different aisles==).

## Skewed

When partitions are too skewed and having several large partitions, this is called a *Skewed Partitions*. The major problem: 
- *inefficient utilisation* 
	- sometime called *inefficient parallelism*
	- writes are stuck and need to wait for large partition computation to complete
	- inefficient use of computation resources because a larger workflow can well be broken down to more distributed smaller workloads

## Hotspots

Another common problem of partitions is the *Hotspot Partitions*, which happens when several partitions are accessed/ read more frequent than others. ==A higher traffic volumes to these Hotspots will reduce the performance of the Nodes because they are overloaded by lots of reads==. 

This can happen to both high skewed partitions or normal sized partitioned:
- *skewed hotspots* - large partitions contain more data that needs to be accessed by more users
- *hotkey hotspots* - a normal sized partitions are simpler contain data that are accessed by lots of users, probably the data storing are more popular
