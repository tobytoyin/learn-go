# Leaderless Replication Concurrent Writes 


Concurrent Writes in a Leaderless Replication is often more tricky then other distributed Replica. This is because writes/ sets can happen during the "write" queries and [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-38-17-65500#Replication Repair|self-repairing]] phase.

## Slow Writes Queries

In this scenario, the 1st writes (red) is causing conflicts due to concurrent writes. While the more recent writes (green) is concurrently writing into the Nodes, another Red writes overwrite the more recent data in Node A because the 1st write took a longer time to finish.

## Self Repairing Writes

![[3_hidden/_images/repair-concurrent-20221114213415.png]]

In this scenario, client makes "read" query to Node A and Node B is not being randomly picked. Since Node A existing writes query still hasn't completed, the self-repairing mechanism mistook the old data in Node A being the most recent one and incorrectly repaired Node B's.

## Last Write Wins
The *Last Write Wins* approach requires the application to attach a ***writes timestamp*** to resolve the conflict. In this case, the records read from multiple Nodes would be resolved by discarding all the records with non-latest timestamp.
