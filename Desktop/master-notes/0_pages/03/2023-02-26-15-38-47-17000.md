# Hash Key Partitioning 

*Hash Key (Range) Partitioning* shares the same process with [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-13-11-48000|Key Range Partitioning]], with the main difference to **scan the hash-key range rather the sorted-key range**: 
1. hash the data by key(s) ‚Üí call this *hash key*
2. sort data by hash key
3. assign indices on data by a fixed-size interval (i.e., stride) it falls into
4. allocated data to partition by their assigned indices

## Process illustration

We need several parameters for Hash Key partitioning: 
- `hashFunc` - deterministic *Hash Function*, that guarantees same value with the same input
- `keys` - keys to extract from the data 
- `min` & `max` - the pre-determined range of the fixed-sized interval
- `numPartitions` - (optional) upper bound of partitions (see [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-13-11-48000#^number-of-partitions|more]])

The process (left to right) mainly follows as: 
1. apply hash function (e.g., MD5) to the data' keys `hashFunc(keys)`
2. sort the data by their hash keys
3. apply a rolling scan range on sorted data's hash keys
	- in this example `min=0, max=3`, therefore the interval is of size 3
4. Records that falls into the scan are assigned a particular ID
	- e.g., first three records > ID = 0
	- second three records > ID = 1
	- (optional) if defined `numPartitions=3`, the rest of the records > ID = 2
5. physically allocate the records to partitioned storage based on the ID

> [!NOTE]
> As shown, starting from step-3 onwards, it is pretty much the same as Key Range Partitioning, which relies on the hashKey instead of the extracted keys.

##  Use Cases 

### Non-numerical Partitioning

By Hashing non-numerical keys (e.g., strings) into numerical values, this allow data to be sorted numerically. 

- similar data, i.e., same strings, are partitioned closer together

### Hotspot Reliefs
Hash Key Partitions mainly used to **ensure data being evenly distributed** even when there exist some [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600|hotkeys]]. Even when certain keys are more frequent than others, sorted hash-key could be allocated into different reasonably sized-partitions through the striding process. 

This also retain the benefit of partitioning similar data, i.e., same key string, closer together. This is because data with the same stringKey would yield the same hashKey, allowing them to arrange closer together and archive lower degree of [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600#Spread|spread]].
