When querying a commonly used Fields on [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-19-16-10-50|Object Type]] that contains many Fields, it become very cumbersome to keep repeating the required Fields. 

A *Fragment* is useful to abstract out a set of Fields into a collection of Fields, which can later to be reuse in different Queries: 

```graphql
type User {
	name: String!
	age: Int!
	email: String!
	address: String!
	city: String!
}

# Fields that are related to contact info
fragment contactDetails on User {
	name
	email
	address
}
```

When writing a Query that extract those Fields, we can simplify it without explicitly typing them all out: 

```graphql
{
	getAllUsers {
		...contactDetails
	}
}

# is the same as
{
	getAllUsers {
		name
		email 
		address
	}
}
```


> [!Tip]
> In many programming language, this is referred as *unpacking*.

## Inline Fragments

An *inline fragment* is used as a "Fields unpacking" when a query returns with [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-19-22-30-17#Union Type|mixture of Object Types]]. This allows the Query to extract certain Fields that only exist within certain Object Type. 

```graphql
{
	getAllUser {
		name
		... on Employee {
			department
		}
		... on Contractor {
			vendor
		}
	}
}
```

This query returns the data with the following: 
- when the returned `User` is `Employee` typed, returns `name` and `department`
- when the returned `User` is `Contractor` typed, returns `name` and `vendor`
