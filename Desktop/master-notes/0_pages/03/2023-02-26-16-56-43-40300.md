# Factory Pattern 

*Factory Pattern* [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800|Design Pattern]] aims to refactor the class *selection & creation layer* within the main function. This emphasises on having the main operations focuses on the core logics; the *Factory* focuses on class selection which can provide the right typed inputs for the main function. 

Another way to look at Factory Pattern is to allowing a programmatic way to create class objects, i.e., through functions/ methods interface without interacting with the class directly.

## 🏆 Goals 

- **Changes in Usage** 
	- objects and functionalities mostly static but often need to instantiate new concrete class for different scenario
- **Dependency Injection**
	- the main logic focuses only on the core operation implementation
	- the Factory focuses on the determining the outputs decision based on inputs
	- this decoupling allows having the core logics being untouched when only modifying on the choices selection
- **Reusable Usage**
	- A Factory can be modified and reuse by different programme
- **Programmatic Creation**
	- class creation can be done more programmatically, e.g., using ENUM; string, instead of directly interacting with the class

## 📖 Use Cases Traits

### Main Decision using Runtime Variables

We have a Main function/ operation that makes decision during runtime, which often written as a large if-else statement within the Main logic in order to return a `class` for the next logic.

> [!tip]- Reusable Operations
> Our Main function needs to be reusable and modified based on different usage scenarios. 
> The most naive way to do this is to create two separated Main function that does exactly the same thing but with different choices in if-else statement (See [[#Subclass Factories Design]]).

## 🏭 Simple Factory Pattern

The simplest Factory Pattern is about refactoring the "selection layer" from the main application into a `Factory` class and it is responsible for handling the class selection rules and creation .

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230131155124.png|500]]
- `Client` is a class which contains the `main` method (the core logic behind the application)
- `Factory` is stored within the class interacted within the `main` execution. This selects and creates the required class object within `Factory`'s method

### Benefits
The major benefit is that the `Client` doesn't need to know what classes (`A`, `B` in our example) are available for creation. This makes the `Client` a standalone, whenever more classes are added; selection rules are modified, `Client` doesn't require code changes. 

> [!Tip]- UML
> The Factory Pattern UML simply indicates that `Client` has access `Factory` in order to retrieve classes it creates.

> [!NOTE]- Factory vs Strategy Pattern
> The general structure of Factory Pattern and [[0_pages/05/2023-10-11-00-00-52-60000|Terminologies]] are quite similar. However there's one major difference: 
> - Strategy Pattern - Strategy class is *selected before the operation*
> - Factory Pattern - class is *created during the operation*
> This makes Strategy Design a "*behavioural pattern*" whereas Factory Design a "*[[0_pages/03/2023-10-11-00-00-13-38900|Creational Pattern]]*".

## 🏭🏭 Subclass Factories Design

One benefit of having a "Factory" in generating class instance is that `Client` application become more reusable.
Instead of having to hard-code different Main functions as to implement different class selections. A Factory can be subclassed: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230131162322.png|500]]

- `Factory` is a subclass of a `FactoryInterface`
- `Client` uses a [[0_pages/05/2023-10-11-00-00-52-60000|Terminologies]], i.e., the Strategy class is based on which `Factory` should be used - `Main( whatFactory )`

This allows different variety of `Client` being implemented. For example, we can have: 
- `ClientA = Client(FactoryA)` that can only choices among class `A` and `B`
- `ClinetB = Client(FactoryB)` that can choose among different classes.

> [!Tip]- UML
> This UML indicates that both `Client` and `Factory` are now can be abstracted. 
> - `ConcreteClient` are implemented by indicate which `Factory` to use
> - `ConcreteFactory` are implemented by defining which `Class` it can create
