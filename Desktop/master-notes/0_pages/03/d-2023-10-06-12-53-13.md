*Elastic Load Balancer* is a load balancer managed by AWS to: 
- conduct health checks on *target groups*, i.e., resources within the same network group
- route and divert network traffics to different IP addresses
- control network traffics volumes to AWS resources

## Network Load Balancer

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-16-21-46#^nlb]]

Network Load Balancer (*NLB*) is used to **route network traffics to target groups** to maintain a evenly traffics among servers. This involves: 

1. receives traffics from network gateway
2. apply hash algorithm on the network packet's contents (e.g., IP address)
3. using the hash value to "randomly" distribute traffics to different targets

NLB conducts load balancing at the network level and **only concerns on providing ultra-efficient traffic distributions**.

## Application Load Balancer

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-16-21-46#^alb]]

Application Load Balancer (*ALB*) is aimed to **route requests traffics to the right place**. This is by routing requests to the appropriate target groups based on defined Rules: 
1. receives traffics from network gateway
2. unpack [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-29-15-51-26|L7 network request contents]]  from traffics (e.g., header, body, URL path & params, etc..)
3. *Rule Listener* for each Target Group pull valid traffics to targets 

This approach **allows an application break down into smaller deployable applications** (e.g., Lambda's endpoint, single-endpoint API). 

> [!NOTE]- ALB vs API Gateway
> ALB is similar to [[0_pages/04/d-2023-05-30-22-13-00-635|API Gateway]], as both aims to route different requests to different "endpoints". However, they work quite differently:
> - ALB provides additional rule checking on the requests contents on top of request URL
> - API Gateway routes to different logics handler within the Node; ALB routes to different compute instances. This allows more compute intensive "endpoints" to route to more power instances.

## Gateway Load Balancer

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-16-21-46#^GLB]]

Gateway Load Balancer (*GLB*) aims to route a round-trip from one VPC to another VPC, e.g., by egress traffics to a different [[0_pages/04/d-2023-08-29-14-35-19|VPC Endpoint]] then ingress its traffic back. This allows network packets **travels to another application hosts on a different VPC before routing to the Target Group**.
