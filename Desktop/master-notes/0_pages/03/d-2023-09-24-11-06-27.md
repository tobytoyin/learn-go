## Async-Await

While Async Programme indicates a "start and move on" mechanism, allowing multiple functions to execute concurrently. We might want our programme to **start execution when the prior async functions are completed**. For example: 

- when all required async API requests are done (data presents), continue
- when all required async DB write are done, continue

An *Async-Await Programme* represents a type of [[0_pages/03/d-2023-07-02-10-25-33|Asynchronous Programme]] that needs to "**wait for synchronised results**", i.e., await for required async completions. This extends to a mechanism: "*start and move on, coordinate on the results*"

The general steps are: 
1. use multiple Threads for async functions to start multiple external works (start and move on) and each Thread listens for their own results
2. use a main Thread for the await function: 
	- *block Main Thread* to stop the downstream logics in await function to start 
3. during the *Await Blocking*, switch between concurrent Threads to: 
	- check each Thread's async function completions
	- use *await listener* to check if each async function is done
4. when all the asyncs are completed → [[#Await Escapes|escape from await]] → starts the downstream function

## Await Escapes

There are several scenarios to escape from an *await blocking*:
- Success - async function completes and returns expected result
- Failure - async function completes/ fails and returns unexpected result
- Timeout - async function took more time than expected

This implies that the starting of an await function is reactively determined by the result(s) of Await Listener. Languages that have extensive supports for async-await generally use: 
- *Future*/ *Promise* - as a logical switch within the await function based on scenarios: 
	- default - logics under Success scenario
	- error - exception logics under Failure scenario
	- timeout error - exception logics under Timeout scenario

## Why Async-Await is Concurrency?

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231117110004.png]]
Async-Await Programme represents a [[0_pages/03/d-2023-06-30-22-06-11|Concurrency]] paradigm because of how different Async functions manipulates Threads in a Process. 

Under the Async-Await approach: 
- the non-async part of `AsyncA` and `AsyncB` functions are started sequentially
- `AsyncA`, `AsyncB`, `Await C` both "concurrently" maintain their own Thread to listen for results running on outside of its Thread
- concurrency herein describes - **running multiple non-Thread blocking logics simultaneously** (e.g., logics using external resources)

Under [[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-01-16-25-04|Sequential Execution Approach]]:
- all the functions are started sequentially
- all the executions and results listening happen under the same Thread
- dependency are sequentially cascading downwards

## Note - What is Async Sleep?

Many examples from the Internet tend to use `sleep` vs Async-version `sleep` to showcase Async-Await functionalities. The use of `sleep` is often misleading to express what the programme is actually doing. 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231117111350.png]]
Instead of indicating "not doing anything", the use of async `sleep` is simply to **mock certain kind of non-thread blocking external processes**. Instead of having an actual process/ daemon running in the background to test the async function, we mock that process with async `sleep` as to simulate the time for that process.
