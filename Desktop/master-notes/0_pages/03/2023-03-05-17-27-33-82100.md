# Distributed Storage 


In a distributed storage system, there are main concepts in storing files: 
1. *Replication* 
2. *Partitioning*
---
## Replication 

Replication is about making data fault tolerance & highly available. This is by storing data across multiple Nodes and Disks to avoid having all the data stored in a single place:

## Partitioning
Partitioning data is about making a large piece of data into small chunks.


---
## Filesystem vs Database

A distributed storage can be in a form of *distributed filesystem* or *distributed database*.
- distributed filesystem - store all kinds of raw data in bytes sequences 
- distributed database - store only data that follows a Data Model

Both of these storage implementation utilise replication and partitions to allow distribution in a computer cluster.
