*Kafka Brokers* maintain fault tolerance by using [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-37-35-93600|Leader-based Replication]]: 
- for each [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-08-12-26-59|Topic partition]], there is a *Leader partition* storing at one Kafka Broker's Node
- an Replica of the same Topic partition is copied and distributed to another Broker's Node to provide resilience 

This replication approach is similar to how [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]] works (storing Replica data in other Nods) in replicating its partitioned Topics Messages.
