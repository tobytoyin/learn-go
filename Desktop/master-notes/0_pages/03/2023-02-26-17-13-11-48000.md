# Key Range Partitioning 

The idea of *Key Range Partitioning* is to: 
1. sort data by selected numerical key(s)
2. assign indices on data by a fixed-size interval (i.e., *stride*) it falls into
3. allocated data to partition by their assigned indices

The main reasoning for this is that when data are being sorted by a key, relevant/ similar data would be arranged closer to each others after sorting. This can avoid having data being partitioned [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600#Spread|in complete randomness]].

## Process illustration

We need several parameters for Key Range partitioning: 
- `keys` - keys to extract from the data 
- `min` & `max` - the pre-determined range of the interval (size of stride)
- `numPartitions` - (optional) upper bound of the number of partitions to have

> [!Question]- What about "number of partitions"?
> The number of partitions in *scan-based partitioning* is usually dynamic/ upper bounded. This is because the partition ID (eqv. number of partitions) are generated while rolling the stride. 
> Therefore, it is common to use the minimum value of the boundary:
> `min(scannedPartitions, numPartitions)`

The process (left to right) of Key Range Partitioning mainly follows as: 
1.  sort the original data by the `keys` 
2. apply a rolling stride on sorted data's `keys`
	- in this example `min=0, max=3`, therefore stride size is 3
3. Records that falls into the scan are assigned a particular ID
	- e.g., first three records > ID = 0
	- second three records > ID = 1
	- rest of records exceed the last Interval belongs to the last partition ID
4. physically allocate the records to partitioned storage based on the ID

## Distributed Range Scanning

> [!Tip]
> From the process, it shows that the rolling of "Scan Range" is single-threaded (i.e., only one rolling stride to assign one partition ID at a time). 
> This process can be distributed by the use of [[2023-03-12-16-54-40-48100|Stride Scanning Method]]:

## ✅ Use Cases 

### Partition by Ordinal Variables
Key-Range Partition is particularly useful when partitioning data with *Ordinal Variables*, e.g., *timestamps* and *rankings*. 
This allows data within a range being closer to each others after sorting. Making computation like "window functions" and searching like time range scans more efficient. 

### Secondary Keys Sorting
Key Range Partition is also prone to [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-42-45600|skewed partitions]] when some keys are more popular and falling under the same sorted intervals (e.d., more data during peak hours in a store). We can apply *Secondary Keys* to the sorting.

### Easy to Perform
Key-Range Partition can be easily and efficiently perform without having to know too much details about the metadata of the database. This is because the partitioning process only involves: sort > interval cuts > assign. This saves additional computation having to hash the values.

## Disadvantages

The key disadvantages is prone to [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-19-37-01900|skewed partition]]: 
- when lots of records share the same keys, they will allocate closer together after sort and **create hotspots of several partitions**
- when the upper bound of partitions (`numPartitions`) is reached, the rest will likely dump into a very large partition. This requires the query size being quite stable; having some metadata about the query size.
