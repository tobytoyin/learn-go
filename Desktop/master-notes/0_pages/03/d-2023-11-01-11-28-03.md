A typical AWS architecture for a Three Tier Web application are structured within a single [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630|VPC]]: 
- frontend layer - mainly composes of CloudFront to serve webpage/ contents, or an API Gateway for RESTful API. Traffics to the frontend are commonly routed through an [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-24-17-10-42|Internet Gateway]] and distribute traffics using [[0_pages/03/d-2023-10-06-12-53-13|ALB]]
- application layer - composes of a Private Subnet fronted by the ALB. [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-14-13-08-24|Auto Scaling Group]] would scale compute instances that handle application logics based on amount of traffics from ALB
- storage layer - can be composes of different managed database services provided by AWS and is only reachable by the "Application Layer Private Subnet"
