*Partition* can be considered as **splitting a single full Table into smaller subset of Tables**. ^08210a

The goal of Partitioning is to achieve scalability and efficiency through [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|distribution]]. For example: 
- data can be query & search efficiently by many readers 
- data can be processed in parallel by many processors
- data can be scanned quicker (on sub-Tables level) without scanning all data
- better fault tolerance, as to backup smaller Tables in different locations

## Partitioning Index

The core principle in partitioning data relies on **creating indices on Records**, such that data with the same index are allocated into the same location, i.e., a partition. Index creation is commonly called a *Partitioning Function* (or Partitioner). ^partition-strategy-principle

Partitioning based on key has certain benefits than [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-41-12-11700|looking up an index]]/ address table in a distributed storage: 
- reduce additional computation to read Index Table to write/ read data
- easier to redistribute data without updating Index Table (*repartition*)

## Partitioning Strategies

Partitioning usually relies on randomly, consistently, and uniformly distributing data into different systems. This involves using [[d-2023-07-12-23-34-41|Consistent Hashing]] to create an random partition key to archive this. 

There are also several deterministic approaches in assigning index to cater for specifics systems usages:
