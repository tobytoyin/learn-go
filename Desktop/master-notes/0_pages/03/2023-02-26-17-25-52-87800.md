# HDFS 

## 📦 Storage in Cluster

In a physical computer, multiple hard-disks can be installed in it. Even we stored our files in separate disk, the file manager usually can do a good job by providing the path when searching for a particular file.

_Hadoop Distributed File System_ (HDFS) shares a similar concept, it instead extends this concept from one computer into multiple clusters of computers and each cluster relies on [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-22-07-17400|Name Node]] and [Data Node](https://www.notion.so/Data-Node-c9d4e00dbf4d44fb87eafd4ae246a8b3) to store and organise the data.

## 💾 Storage Approach

Since the Name Node only contains the metadata and not responsible for storing the actual data. It mainly responsible to find where the data required is stored at and send a read command to the designated Data Node to retrieve them.

The Data Node itself is the machine that contains processing power and disks. The actual data are stored in the disk and only provide/ compute the required data following the Name Node's command. This approach is a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-22-24-34100|Shared-Nothing Architecture]].

> [!example]-
> For example, a company may partition its data by different departments. To retrieve the data from “marketing department”, the Name Nodes contain the information on where different fragment of these “marketing” data are stored across the cluster and gather the data from the Data Nodes that are storing them.

## 🚨 Fault Tolerance Approach

To improve lookup efficiency and fault tolerance, HDFS stores 3 copies of a data block (Replica).

-   2 blocks of the same data are stored in 2 different Data Nodes under the same cluster
-   1 block of the same data is stored in 1 different Data Node in different cluster

When storage is completed, the Data Nodes index the location of the data to the Name Node.
