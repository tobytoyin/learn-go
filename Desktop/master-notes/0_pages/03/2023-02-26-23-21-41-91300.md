## üïπ Control Panel Processes

Control Panel's Nodes (Master Nodes) run various services to manage the cluster: 
- *etcd* - a basic key-value storage, mainly to store metadata of the cluster & Nodes
- *scheduler* - a deployment process, mainly to deploy Pods to Nodes
- *API server* - a communication process, mainly to allow cluster to make communications to external, or among different Nodes
- *control manager* - controller mainly maintain and manage the lifecycle of Nodes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Worker Nodes Processes

Each Work Node run various services:
- *Kubelet* - a container agent that communicate with the Control Panel, e.g., receive instruction then execute them in the Node
- *Container Engine* - to execute containers operations, e.g., Docker, Containerd
- *kube-proxy* - mainly controls the [[0_pages/01/2023-03-13-21-42-03-20900#Networks|network]] of the Node so that it can communicate with others

## üïπ Controller

A *Controller* is a high level process that maintain, observe, and manage the state of Pods. The Controller are constantly comparing the *Current State* of the cluster with the *Desired State*, then make the necessary changes to reach the desired cluster state.

There are several Controllers in K8s, for example: 
- *Deployment Controller* - make updates/ deployments of [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Pod]] to Nodes
- *ReplicaSet Controller* - creates more Nodes/ Pods based on a ReplicaSet
- *Job Controller* - activate scheduled processes
