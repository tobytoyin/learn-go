## Programming in OOP

The most basic OOP programme can look something like this: 

![[3_hidden/_images/basic-flow-20221216213151.png|500]] 

An ***Object*** that execute some ***Logic*** (Methods) then generate some ***Outputs*** (this could be both Logic/ Object). As show in the diagram, the components that we can change in this simple programme to allow more flexibility is "*Object*" and "*Logic*". 

### Changes & Statics Components

Design Patterns is a way to capture which components would change, or which would be static: 
- expect Logics to vary
- expect Objects to have varieties
- expect Usage/ Implementations to vary

## Key Challenges in OOP Designs

The reason why we need to think about Design Patterns is because of the balance between: 

- *Reusability* 
	- Objects that are too loose are difficult to be reused because they need to be reimplemented from scratches all the time
- *Maintainability*
	- Objects that are too static creates of a unwanted coupling and dependency become locked

### Closed for Modification, Open for Extension

Not every components need to be common/ dynamics, a good design aim to allow: 
 - changeable components become easy to maintain, extend, and replaced
 - statics components are more reusable and won't affect new implementations

## Composition Design ("HAS-A" relationship)

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230626131219.png]]

One common thing to do in a class is to execute logics based on among a set of Logics (family of Algorithm). 

The *Composition Design* aims to abstract away every details of different implementations and only relies an *interface* to expect the bare-minimum of methods/ attributes. In order word - "As long as the `client` knows how to run it (interface)"

For example:
- a `client` object takes in `interface` class as inputs ("composition")
- this represents a "*HAS-A*" relationships, i.e., `client` HAS-A `interface` and able to access by `client.interface` 
- the main entry point on `interface` is through its abstract `method()` - "**Client has-a Interface to execute `client.interface.method()`**"

Common examples of `interface` contain a standard entry point to be used (e.g., `main`, `run`, `execute`, etc...) and allow new implementation through `BaseClass`

## Inheritance Design ("IS-A" relationship)

![[3_hidden/_images/inheritance-20221216215402.png|500]] 

One common component to have lots of variety is the Object and often expects different kinds of Object to do the same thing (e.g., Man and Woman both can "walk"). This is usually done by a form of *==Inheritance==*: 
- object "*IS-A*" category of another object (aka a class abstraction)
- Different Objects are "inheriting" the Trait & "implementing" their own methods
