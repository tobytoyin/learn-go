# Distributed System 

## üï∏Ô∏è  What is a Distributed System?

When working with traditional computing system, a system is comprises of a single machine (*one-machine-one-system*). All the applications (i.e., *processes*) are running inside a single machine. 

In a distributed system (aka *Cluster*), it doesn't rely on a single machine (aka *Node*) but having many machines (*many-machine-one-system*). The machines within the Cluster communicate with others via a [[0_pages/04/d-2023-06-03-17-32-28-427|Network]].

==Processes are running on multiple machines instead of one==. Some Processes are running on all Nodes and some run on selected Nodes. 
Because there multiple machines running multiple processes, a distributed system usually defines different class of machine ([[#Master Node]] & [[#Worker Node]]) as a way to coordinate different machines and processes.

## ü§¥üèª Master Node

*Master Node* is the core part of a cluster and usually involves in tasks like: 
- maintaining the lifecycle of the distributed system and Worker Nodes, ==e.g, Nodes scaling, system tears down, system starting etc==.
- handling requests outside of the distributed system
- handling communication & metadata of the distributed system and Worker Nodes

## üë∑üèª Worker Node

*Worker Nodes* (aka *Slave Nodes*) are usually some very basic machines that serves as the computation resources of a distributed system (similar to CPU core of a single machine). They are mainly used as: 
- computation resources
- storage resources
- allow scaling and replication

## Ways of Working 
- master node allocate tasks to worker nodes 
- worker nodes report results back to master node
