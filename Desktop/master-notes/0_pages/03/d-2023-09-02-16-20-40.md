## Basics Components of LLM Architectures

There are several different types of architectures in using LLM models

- Basic LLM - basics applications that takes inputs (prompt) and generates outputs
- Chat LLM - LLM that takes a "role-based messages" and generates output
- Memory-based LLM - LLM that uses previous prompts to construct new inputs prompts

## Basic LLM Components

![[c-2023-09-06-20-50#^basic-llm]]

A LLM Application is simple: 
- Input Text - that is input by users
- *Prompt* - is a "modified text input" that acts as input of a LLM model. A Prompt aims to **add additional text inputs** (hidden from users) to give the model extra instructions, context, constraints, etc. The process of modifying inputs to Prompts is mainly managed by a *Prompt Template* as [[d-2023-09-06-21-28-55|Prompt Engineering]]
- a LLM model consumes the Prompt inputs and then generates another output text

## Chat LLM Components

![[c-2023-09-06-20-50#^chat-llm]]

A Chat LLM Model is a variant of LLM model mainly that mainly has a different approach in structure input prompts. This involves using *roles* along with their inputs to structure into a *message*. All of these messages are structured into a single prompt to the LLM model.

## Memory-based Components

![[c-2023-09-06-20-50#^memory-llm]]

A LLM application with "memory" has a two mechanisms. A "context loop" is maintained by: 
- *Memory* - which stores all the outputs (either as prompts/ messages). These previous prompts will further (unknowingly) add into the next prompt along with user texts (usually by modifying the prompt template as "history" or context)
- Outputs are also passed into the memory storage component
