An *Aliases* (or *Named Query*) is useful if we need to apply a key to the returned result. This is useful in some scenarios:
- executing the same Query multiple times in a single request
- apply the key to multiple Query for easier usage later

---
## Example

Named Query works like this: 

```graphql
{
	<key>: <query>
	user1: getUser(id: "1") { name }
	user2: getUser(id: "2") { name }
}
```

The result would be returned with the assigned Alias: 

```json
{
	"data": {
		"user1": {"name": "name1"}, 
		"user2": {"name": "name2"}
	}
}
```
