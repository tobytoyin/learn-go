# Shared-Nothing Architecture 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20221127170554.png]]

The "Shared-Nothing" architecture is one way to decouple the shared disk by making Nodes & Disks scalable together.

- All the data are stored in a separate container connected to just one head Node
- horizontally scaled by adding more Nodes & Disks replica
	- disks are smaller in each Node
	- CPUs are smaller in each Node

## Problems

Because CPUs and Disks are scaled together, ==it might not fit unbalanced CPU & Disks usage==. This makes it difficult to estimate the right Disk size w.r.t the volume of transactions and this creates additional overheads (unused disks space & computation). 

For example: 
- increased clients requests but data volume unchanged (disks under utilised)
- increased data volume but clients requests unchanged (CPUs under utilised)
