# Leader-based Replication 
   
The *Leader Followers Replication* is the most common approach in handling data IO in a [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|distributed system]]. 
An [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-33-82100#Replication|Replication]] simply means that each distributed data storage in a database should have the same copy of data as in the Leader.

For every write or updates operation into a database, these operations are exclusively handled by a single data master node (*Leader*). 
Because databases are commonly keeping track of data stored based on log files (appending data). These logs are also "replicated" to the distributed work nodes (*Followers*) to reflect the changes on their own storages.

While the Leader is maintained as data source-of-truth, read operations are limited to query on Follower nodes.

## Replication Methods

There are several ways to replicate the data in each Follower to look like the data stored in the Leader: 

- **Statement Execution**
  This basically means the same write query statements are executed on the Leader are passed down to the Followers to execute as well. ^3b9eb8
  
- **Write-ahead Log Shipping** 
  Because databases are commonly keeping track of data stored based on log files (appending data). The same transaction log file can be passed down to each Follower, so that they can also resurface the records appropriately based on the logs. 
  
- **Row-based Replication**
  Instead of relying on logs to update the data stored in Followers. *Logical Row-based Replication* aims to pass down new records from Leader to Followers with additional instructions. So when read query are executed on the Followers, it would also execute a set of "logics" that transform it's underlying data. 
  (It is similar to "Statement Execution" Replication but there are no additional logs to change the underlying data storage.)

## Replication Challenges

With this replication approach, the most common errors usually occurs during the degree of time lags between sending replication commands & queries from the Master Node to different Worker Nodes.
