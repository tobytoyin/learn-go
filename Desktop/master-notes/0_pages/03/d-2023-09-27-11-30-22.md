Scala's *Contextual Parameter* is an approach to allow the compiler to "implicitly" and automatically look for certain object/ types and passes it directly as parameters: 
- `implicit` - paired parameters and defined object

> [!NOTE]- "global" parameter
> This is similar to `global` in Python but instead of searching within the entire runtime scope, Scala requires us to define to define which contextual scope to reference. 

Using the following function in both explicit and implicit version would be a good starting point on how `implicit` parameters work.

## Explicit Function

An "Explicit" Function is the normal way of defining a function and its parameters. 

```scala
// package of Colour type and a `draw` function
object DrawExplicit {
  case class Colour(value: String)

  def draw(text: String, colour: Colour): String =
    s"[with: $colour] { $text }"
}

@main def ExplicitFunction(): Unit =
  import DrawExplicit._

  val red: Colour = Colour("red")
  
  // pass into function params explicitly
  val content: String = draw("hello world", colour = red)
```

- in `DrawExplicit`, it packages a `Colour` class and a `draw(...)`
- the `draw` function explicitly takes in `text` and `colour` as arguments
- when using `draw`, it also needs to have a valid typed `text` and `colour` passed as parameters to call the function

---
## Implicit Function

Passing the `Colour` object sometimes might not be desired. For example: 
- when an object is [[0_pages/05/2023-03-12-16-55-04-34900|Singleton]], then if could just reference it implicitly in the entire context
- a common object under a context, `implicit` provides a safely scoped "global" variable 

We can rewrite the explicit version to an `implicit` function: 

```scala
// package of Colour type and a `draw` function
object DrawImplicit {
  case class Colour(value: String)

  // define `colour` as implicit parameter
  def draw(text: String)(implicit colour: Colour): String =
    s"[with: $colour] { $text }"

}

@main def ImplicitFunction(): Unit =
  import DrawImplicit._

  // define this variable as implicit variable
  // to allow `draw` to pick this up
  implicit val red: Colour = Colour("red")
  val content: String = draw("hello world")

```

The implicit function has this syntax: `def fn(<params>)(implict <params>)`. This indication of `implicit` as the function's argument allows Scala to lookup the runtime context for an `implicit` variable with the same type. 

The `implicit val` indicates the variable that should be picked up by the implicit function. 

For example, when the function defines: 
- `implict colour: Colour` as the required implicit argument
- it would search for another `implict` variable with `Colour` type
