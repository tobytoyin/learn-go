When using [[0_pages/02/2023-03-20-12-21-40-09600|Poetry]] to package Python modules, it is often that our project is structured in this way: 

```shell
.
├── README.rst
├── poetry.lock
├── pyproject.toml
├── my_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_main.py
```

- `my_project/` contains the modules scripts
- `tests/` contains the unit-tests for the modules

---
## ImportError Problem

To properly write tests for our modules, we need to consider `my_project/` itself being a deployable library. We can write our test in PyTest like this: 

```python
# tests/test_main.py
from my_project.main import something

def test_main(): 
	assert something() == 'my expectation'
```

---
## Running Tests

We can run tests using two methods: 

### Using Poetry directly

```shell
poetry run pytest # this is the basics
poetry run pytest -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG  # more details
```

### Using virtual environment 

```shell
poetry install  # install dependency and create .venv
source .venv/bin/activate 
pytest tests/
```
