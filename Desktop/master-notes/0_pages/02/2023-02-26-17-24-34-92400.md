## üÜé Resources Kind

The `kind` keyword in a Kubernetes YAML indicates ==the type of resources/ actions that we want the cluster API to support/ perform==. 


> [!Tip]
> Eqv what `kind` of API request we send to a K8s cluster and execute on

In order words, the manifest contents of a specific `kind` defines which API endpoint should be used and the payload details for it.

> [!example]- Common `kinds`
> The most common type of resources we want the API to do is: 
> - `kind: Pod` - create a Pod in a cluster 
> - `kind: Deployment` - create Pods [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-09-12-28000|deployment]] in a cluster 
> - `kind: Service` - form a [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|network]] among Pods in a cluster

## üëÄ Looking up Resource 

==Different Resources have different API endpoints as well as their API group==. Since K8s is extendable by different 3rd parties, there are many different resource we can reference. 

We can lookup the keywords for different Resource (`kind`) and their API group + version (`apiVersion`) with: 

```shell
kubectl api-resources
```

This returns all the resource that the K8s API can perform on a cluster through YAML:

- `NAME` - the command in `kubectl`
- `SHORTNAMES` - the service abbreviation, usually displayed in K8s icons
- `APIVERSION` - latest version support and `apiVersion` in YAML
- `NAMESPACED` - whether we can create namespace for the resource
- `KIND` - API endpoint and `kind` in YAML
