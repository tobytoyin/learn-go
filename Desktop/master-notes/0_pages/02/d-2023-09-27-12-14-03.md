Think in Functional Programming: 
- application as "data flow"
- tranformations of data by a bunch of functions
- generating outputs

## The Key of FP

FP applications only work on *Immutable values* (constants) and *pure functions*: 
- immutable values means that there are no variables and side effect, it only generates a new output
- Pure Functions - output only depends on the input and there are no side-effect. *Side Effect* means that a function should not concern itself with anything other than transformations. Things like read/ write, logging are done *outside of the function*. 

- how do FP handle I/O?
- how to exchange/ update variables when using immutable values?

## Pure Function

A *Pure Function* can be thought of as a calculator, which 

> [!tip]- **Output only based Inputs and internal algorithm**
> If we input "1 + 1", a pure function can only dependent on the "1" and "+". This is contrast to OOP which a "method" could access the properties of an input object (e.g., `this.property`) and modify the outputs.

> [!Tip]- No Side-effects
> *No Side-effects* means that a pure function should not interact/ reference anything of the outside world, e.g., anything related to Read/ Write, database connections. A Function only concerns with inputs & its local implementation and nothing more. 

> [!Tip]- Results are always the same
> There are no randomness or outside inference that can change the function's behaviour. This allows a function to output the same result all the time. E.g., `hash` of the same input always generate the same output.
