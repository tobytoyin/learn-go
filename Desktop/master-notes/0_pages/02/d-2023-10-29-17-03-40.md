## Direct Messaging System

Instead of having Consumer to poll Records, a *Messaging System* (or Queue) "pushes" each event Record directly to from Producer(s) to Consumer(s). 

![[3_hidden/_images/message-20221222174712.png]]

Instead of batching poll multiple Records, this system allows Producer to directly transmit an event Record to a Consumer and processes it immediately. 
This removes the need to have an intermediate storage to keep Topic Records and each Record is directly transmitted through the network between Producer and Consumer. 

This approach added transmission efficiency by adding more challenges/ sacrifices on "maintaining event arrival orders" and "fault tolerant on missing Records".
