- SQS Standard - ideal when message storage is required and messages are unique
- SQS FIFO - ideal for SQS that needs time ordering, lower throughput rate
- SNS - message storage is not important and messages can be duplicated (at least once delivery)

## Stream Processing Systems in AWS

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231110213442.png]]

In AWS, the three major stream processings systems are SNS, SQS, and Kinesis Data Stream. Each service resemblances different common stream processing systems type: 

*SNS* is a [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-29-17-10-21|Pub-Sub System]] which main focuses is to:
- high load levelling to receive & distribute messages
- ephemeral storage cycle
- based on pushing messages to downstream (as quick as possible)
- at least once delivery and no time ordering
- one-to-many distributed consumers

*SQS* on the other hand is a [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-29-17-06-35|Broker System]] which main focuses is to: 
- high load levelling to receive but low levelling to distribute messages
- permanent storage cycle to act as messages buffer until deletion
- based on pulling messages from upstream
- (SQS FIFO) able to provide exactly once delivery and time ordering
- one-to-one polling consumer

*[[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-29-15-55-45|Kinesis Data Stream]]* is a [[0_pages/02/d-2023-10-29-17-03-40|Direct Messaging System]] which focuses on: 
- high load levelling to receive & distribute messages
- temporary storage cycle (depending on the length of a streaming window)
- based on pushing messages to downstream (real time)
- exactly once delivery and strict time ordering
- one-to-many parallel consumers (by shards)
