Programmes in Go generally follows the below procedures:
1. setup and compile the modules using `go mod init <ModuleName>`
2. manage external dependencies in `go.mod`
3. run the programme by `go run main.go`

## Directory Structure

In Go, scripts are generally organised in this way: 

```sh
myProject (root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod  # compiled dependency file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go # main entry point of the myProject package
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myModule1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stuffs.go  # contains functions myModule1 package
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myModule2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stuffs.go  # contains functions myModule2 package
```

1. We first run `go mod init myProject` at the project root, making this directory being compiled and packaged as a module called `myProject`. This also generates a dependency file in `go.mod`
2. Inside the `myProject`, we have two sub-modules called `myModule1` and `myModule2`. Generally the scripts names are not important but it is import to put scripts that belong to the same package under the same directory

> [!Note]- Recompile
> When we add more scripts, we might need to recompile the module again. In this case, we have to add and compile the directory again: 
> ```sh
> go get -u ./pathToRecompileModule
> go mod tidy
> ```

## How Packaging & Import Works?

### `package`

Every go programmes starts with a `package` keyword. This indicates which module the script would be packaged into. For example, the following indicates this script is packaged into `myModule1` (scripts under `./myModule1` directory): 

```go
// myModule1/stuff.go
package myModule1

func FunctionA() {...}
```

### `import`

`imports` in Go is similar to how we reference items from a file system. 
- items are referenced at the root by `ModuleName/SubModuleName`
- if items are under the same directory in the project, we don't need to import
For example, in `myProject` module:

```go
// main.go
import ( 
	"myProject/myModule1"       // full name import
	mod2 "myProject/myModule2"  // alias import
)
```

- `"myProject/myModule1"` references scripts that starts with `pacakge myModule1`
- `"myProject/myModule2"` references scripts that starts with `package myModule2`
- individual functions are called by `myModule1.FunctionA()`

> [!Tip]- Naming Conventions
> Naming functions/ variables in Go following the below conventions: 
> `PublicNamespace` - PascalCase to indicate public variable 
> `privateNamespace` - camelCase to indicate private variable
> 
> Private variables can only be referenced within the same script, while Public variables can be referenced outside. If we accidentally created fields/ methods using `privateNamespace`, we cannot reference/ modify them
