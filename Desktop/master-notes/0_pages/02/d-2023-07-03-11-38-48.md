When working on multiple [[0_pages/03/d-2023-07-02-12-13-53|Channels]] (usually in a different structure), an application might want to have different Handler to process different Channel. 

Go `select-case` statement is a special case of `switch-case` statement: 
- `switch-case` - switch operations based on logical output
- `select-case` - switch operations based on defined Channels

```go
// open two channels
channelA = make(chan Type)
channelB = make(chan Type)

select {

case varA := <- channelA:
	// handle channelA here
case varB := <- channelB:
	// handle channelB here
case <- time.After(...):
	// handle timeout & clear sync
default: 
	// no event handler
}
```

The above example can be expressed under this timeline: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230703120731.png]]

- when a `select` Goroutine receives: 
	- `ChannelA` from Goroutine1, it executes `methodA`
	- `ChannelB` from Goroutine2, it executes `methodB`
- A `time.After(...)` itself maintains a separated Goroutine, when no Channels are received, this itself triggers a timeout case.

## Simple API Endpoints Example

We can think of this as having multiple API endpoints as separate Channels: 
-  endpointA - channelA 
- endpointB - channelB 
Our application might want to handle endpointA and endpointB differently, thus having a different Function callback based on what kinds of channel receives. 

### API Struct

First a simple API [[0_pages/02/2023-04-15-14-55-46-43900|struct]] would contain all the channels it expects to use by a Method that uses `select` to pick the right Handler. This is a better organisation because this encapsulate all the required dependencies. 

```go
type API struct {
	endpointA chan string
	endpointB chan string
}

// struct methods
func (s *API) Listener() {
	// one endpoint is using one channel, etc.
	// we can `select` different a handler to 
	// opreates on different channel for different endpoints
	for {
		select {
		case payloadA := <- s.endpointA:
			fmt.Println("callback HandlerA() on", payloadA)

		case payloadB := <- s.endpointB:
			fmt.Println("callback HandlerB() on", payloadB)
			
		case <- time.After(time.Second):
			fmt.Println("timeout")
		}
	}
} 
```


### Main

The main host an API Listener to receive channels in the background and invoke the required Handler based on which channel it receives: 

```go 
func main() {
	// we are creating two channels, i.e., variables
	// and store it inside a struct for better organisation
	app := new(API)
	// this would be better if we create an `init` method
	app.endpointA = make(chan string)
	app.endpointB = make(chan string)

	go PokeEndpointA(app.endpointA)
	go PokeEndpointB(app.endpointB)
	
	// a background API listen to invoke handler
	go app.Listener()

	fmt.Scanln()
}
```
