Within an EC2 Instance, there are two kinds of storage: 
- *Instance Store* are storages that attached directly to the instance that is currently running. This is an *ephemeral storage* because the storage's data is removed when the instance's [[0_pages/02/d-2023-11-07-20-55-47|lifecycle]] is ended (e.g., Terminate by scaling down, Terminated due to errors)
- *Persistent Storage* (like EBS) has a independent lifecycle and instance is mounted to it (like computer attaching to an external hard-disks). Similar to external hard-disks, it supports SSD & HDD volumes

## Features of EBS Volumes

When mounting EBS volumes onto EC2 Instances, this can: 
- *Separation of compute and storage* - Instances & EBS volume can attach/ detach flexibility and allow other instances to mount the same EBS. This allows EC2 Instance's compute power and EBS volume size to scale independently according to usage requirements
- *Persistence* - EBS volume's data are persistent and separate on its own. Therefore, data can still be retrieved even when there are instance failure
- *Multi-attach EBS* - Some instances allow *shared access* of EBS volume, this allows multiple instances to read & write the same storage at the same time 
- *Multi-mount EBS* - EC2 instances can mount on multiple different EBS volumes. This allow fine-grind organisation of which volume an instance needs to use

## EBS Usage

There are several scenarios we might need to mount EBS volumes to instances: 

- *Hosting OS* - in a cloud access platform, an instance might need higher performance Block Storage to host OS's system files for individual users
- *Custom Database* - Custom/ 3rd party databases implementation that is not managed by AWS
- *Analytics Engine* - persistent storage for big data application, e.g., models, big data set waiting to be trained (computed)

## Fault Tolerence

EBS can be fault tolerant can be achieved by the following: 
- *point-in-time snapshots* (volume snapshot) - a manually triggered backup to take the data snapshot of the current state and store the data in S3 as archive
- *AWS Data Lifecycle Manager* (data snapshot) - a scheduled trigger to take a snapshot of the data in the EBS
