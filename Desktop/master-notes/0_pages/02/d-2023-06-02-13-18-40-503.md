- When load SQS messages, [SNS to SQS](https://www.notion.so/SNS-to-SQS-a10fc4d461fe47ffb3ab1d1943450260?pvs=21), Lambda handles success responds for the whole batch, regardless of each individual message.
- This would cause lots of redundancy works if the batch keeps failing for just a few messages and lock the whole queue as incomplete
- Implementing your own partial failure mechanism takes effort. We need to raise errors on failure messages; store them; raised them when runtime completed

## Partial Failure Mechanism

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230602131957.png]]

*Partial failure mechanism* take place when some of the messages in a batch is not working (throwing errors). Instead of discarding the whole batch, it only stops the erroneous messages being processed while allow the others going through. This is useful when messages are independent of each other.

## Defining Erroneous Messages

There are ways to define erroneous messages of an event payload:

- corrupted messages that could not being parsed
- invalid payload structure/ values

---
## Code Logics

The overall codes components look roughly like above:

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230602132127.png]]

- `batch_msg` - could be a batch of `event` Messages send to Lambda, or some received messages using AWS API (`boto3`)
- `record_handler` - process a single record from the batch. Errors raised within this handler scope are considered as “failure” with record that can be handled from start to finish is considered as “success”
- `success_handler` takes a “success” record from `record_handler` and do extra things
- `failure_handler` takes a “failure” record and its exception from `record_handler`

## Context Manager vs Decorator

AWS Powertool allows users to select between a Lambda’s event decorator or a context manager.

### Decorator

I find that under an Event-driven Lambda ([[0_pages/03/d-2023-07-02-10-25-33|Asynchronous]]) Lambda that passes `events` directly to Lambda is better with decorator. This is because this approach only cares about the context and processing on a single message.

### Context Manager

I find that works better with CRON (scheduled [[0_pages/01/2023-02-26-14-02-53-84300|Step Functions]]) based messages. One point is that the `event` are empty, so the decorator would have no `event` to work with.

Secondly context manager allows better orchestration of all the messages within the Batch. This makes it easier to “process Batch and return Batch”.
