# AWS Global Infrastructure

## Data Centres, AZ & Region

Data & Services in AWS are clustered and maintain redundancy in multiple data centres within multiple *Availability Zone* (AZ). Different AZ are different cluster network that communicate within an independent *Region*. 

> [!note]- In the Language of Cluster Computing

> - Availability Zone - A Cluster stores within a Network
> - Regions - Different Networks

If we think of different Regions as a separate Cluster's Network. Data that stores within the Region can communicate/ transfer across different AZ. But they are not shared among different Regions.

## Aspects to Consider
- **Compliance** - whether it is a requirement that data needs to be stored and consumed in the same country (Region) in which the company operates 
- **Latency** - closer the AZ/ Region the main audiences are, the lower latency in the service
- **Pricing** - different Region would have different pricing and taxation
- **Service Availability** - some Region would provide more Services, e.g., US Regions generally have more advanced and newly released Services

## Fault Tolerance

The importance of multiple separated AZ in an Region is to ensure high availability and fault tolerance, for both the AWS operation and the user's operation. 

> [!example]- Users' Operation
> Users can make use of multiple AZ to host their application to ensure service is highly available. 
> For example, an application hosted on EC2 instances can be run on separate AZ. So that when one instance failed, there is a backup instance hosted in another AZ.
