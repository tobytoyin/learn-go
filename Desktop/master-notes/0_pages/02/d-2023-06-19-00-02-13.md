# 📓 GoLang Functional Error Handling

`defer` - code block to run when exiting the current function
`panic` - raise error to exit 
`recover` - code block to run when handling error

> [!Tip]- Vs Python
> This is similar to Python in some sense that:
> `defer` - is similar to the `finally` or exit scenario in [[0_pages/01/2023-05-02-22-32-18-90200|Python Context Manager]]; `panic` akin to `raise`; `recover` akin to `except`. 
> 
> The major difference in Go is that these error handlers can be declared before codes being run (preferably at the function's beginning), contrast to Python's declaring it by when it is executed.

## Errors in Go

Non compiled errors in Go are considered as an return values and needs to be explicitly raised using `panic`. By default, when an error is returned from a Function, we would need an additional variable & block to check for error:

```go
value, err := SomeFunction()

if err != nil {
	value := ErrorHandlingFunction()
}
```

This provides a better control on handling or passing errors. For example, whether we want to exit the application (`panic`); handle it by alternative route, etc.

## Raising Errors 

We can use `errors` std library to create our custom errors and raise it by `panic`

```go
import "errors"

func OnlyAllowPositiveNumber(x float32) {
	// raising error
	if x < 0.0 {
		err := errors.New("value is not positive")
		panic(err)
	}
}
```
