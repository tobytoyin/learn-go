Public-Private Keys Access is a network security approach which promotes "free to communicate, authorised to access" security. 
- *Private Key* (encryption key) - are used to communicate with target hosts by encrypting the data
- *Public Key* (decryption key) - is shared to target hosts we want to communicate with, allowing the host to decrypt the data encrypted by the matching Private Key

## Encryption & Decryption

Sending encrypted data using Public and Private Keys are common. This approach provides extra security which only the intended party (with the shared Public Key) can decrypt the data and read the contents. 

This prevents unintended party (shared by mistake/ data be intercepted during transits) to read the contents. This is because the unintended party either doesn't have the Public Key that matches with the encryption Private Key; or doesn't have the Key at all.

## Secured Connections

Public Key and Private Key are often used in *Secured Connections* (e.g., [[wip/SSH Linux|SSH]], SFTP). In which the system hosting the server contains a list of Public Keys which are authorised to connect into its system. 

The intended user makes secured connection to the server using a Private Key that matches to a system's Public Key would be allowed to access the server. Whereas unintended user without the correct Private Key would be denied accesses.

## Key Creation & Key Sharing

To allow intended party to decrypt the message or access a system, public and private keys need to be created and shared. 

To create Private (`*.pem`) and Public (`*.pub`) Key Materials:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa  # follow the procedure afterwards
ls ~/.ssh  # this is where the keys are stored by default

# id_rsa.pub is the public key
# id_rsa     is the private key
```

### Sharing Public Key

Depending on different scenarios, it is most common for an "Requestor" to share the Public Key with an "Authoriser", which allowing Authoriser to add the Public Key into the system and thus granting the matching Private Key access. 

This requires the "Requestor" to execute `ssh-keygen` and share the `.pub` key.


### Sharing Private Key

> [!warning]- Private Key Sharing
> Sometime it is okay to share Private Key (`.pem` file) with the intended user. Most of the time, we should avoid sharing Private Key and should ask the intended user/ sender to provide the Public Key and add into target system instead.


In some scenario, key sharing can be reversed, which the "Authoriser" would generate the key pair within the system, then share the Private Key to a "Requestor" to use it. In this scenario, the "Authoriser" executes the `ssh-keygen` and share the `.pem` key.
