*Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)* is a [[0_pages/04/d-2023-06-03-17-32-28-427|network]] that wrap around all the resources under a specific AWS account. All the Traffics going in or out (*inbound & outbound traffics*) to AWS all goes through a VPC.

By default, each AWS Account comes with a *default AWS VPC* and all resources would be using that VPC if not configured. For more specific configurations/ securities reasons, a *custom VPC* can be created for specific resources. These configuration & traffic policies are defined in each VPC.

## VPC Components

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231101110347.png]]

- *Region* - is where the VPC lives in 
- *Gateways* - is a Network Gateway attaching to VPC that enable connection to the outside world, i.e., allowing internet traffics. A VPC without a Internet Gateway only can communicate within AWS networks and not to the outside world: 
	- *[[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-24-17-10-42|Internet Gateway]]* - for public internet traffics
	- *Virtual Private Gateway* - for private internet traffics (VPN) ^5944ed
- *Subnet* - is a smaller network (sub-network) with its own IP range lives within the VPC in a single AZ hosting AWS Resources. This provides **more granular controls of how AWS resources' IPs should exposure to the network** ^42bb5a
	- *private subnet* - only enable traffics within the VPC's subnets
	- *public subnet* - enable traffics outside of the VPC via additional components
- *IP Range* - IP addresses of VPC's Subnets are controlled by [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-31-21-41-28|CIDR Blocks]]. This provides the maximum amount of IP addresses and their addresses' values
- *[[0_pages/04/d-2023-06-04-17-37-50-418|Route Table]]* - controls how subnets' traffics happen within the VPC
- *[[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-05-22-41-21-618|Firewalls]]* - to controls VPC internal traffics and security of the Subnets/ Instances
- Flow Logs - IP addresses log streams of network traffics

## Fault Tolerance with AZs

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230604135627.png]]

To increase availability and fault tolerance of the application. It is important to replicate the applications (AWS Resources) in at least 2 data centres ([[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-02-06-51200|Availability Zones]]) under the same VPC:
- replicate the Subnets in multiple AZs (with different IP Ranges)
- deploy a replica of Applications in multiple AZs
- (optional) use Load Balancer to spread traffics
