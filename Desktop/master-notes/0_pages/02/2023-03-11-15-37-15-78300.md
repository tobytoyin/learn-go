The Unix Philosophy in design softwares are influential to lots of common software development practices nowadays. It focuses on 4 key elements proposed by Doug McIlroy: 
- automation
- rapid prototyping & experimentation
- incremental iteration
- breaking down larger parts into manageable chunks

## Automation

> Expect the output of every program to become the input to another program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information...

To enable automation of softwares, softwares need to keep it's output simple and reusable by any other new software.  ^c96237

## Rapid Prototyping 

> Design and build software to be tried early, ... Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

Rapid prototyping make continuously making new tools and integrate into the current software to make it easier to be used. Instead of lingering on complicated and awkward tools.

## Breaking down into chunks

> Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".

Continuously adding new software on top of existing one and each software do just one thing based on the [[0_pages/02/2023-03-11-15-37-15-78300#^c96237|minimum amount of information]]. Instead of making complicated software and making it difficult to change.

## Incremental Iteration

> Use tools in preference to lighten a programming task, even if .... expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them

Incrementally finding simple software and adjust our use cases to making our tasks easier. Instead of fully committed into what originally designed and planned. This means we need to design in a way that different tasks can be easily switchable if the uses evolve.
