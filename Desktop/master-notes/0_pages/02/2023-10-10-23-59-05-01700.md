In Python, decorators emphasises on the functions/ methods without the hard coupling of classes (*Function Wrapper*). All the additional algorithms, variables, and contexts can be stored and reference by the "decorated function" outside of its scope (aka [[#Decorator as Closure|closure]]).

## Decorator as HOF

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231022112408.png]]

*Closure* is a concept in [[0_pages/02/d-2023-09-27-12-14-03|Functional Programming]] which allows additional context being passing down to another functional scope. This approach avoid the need to use `class` to store contextual attributes but allow [[0_pages/05/2023-03-05-17-29-07-77300|Pure Functions]] to have memory. 

For example: 

```python
def pure_func(arg1):
	# function on acts on input
	...
	
def closure(param_a):
	result = pure_func(param_a)
	# do additional things ...
	return result
```

A `decorator` is a common way to abstract the function within the Closure context to allow any compatible function to consume the context/ memory within the Closure: 

```python
def higher_order_function(fn):
	def closure(param_a):
		result = fn(param_a)
		# do additional things ...
		return result
	return closure

@higher_order_function(param_a=arg_a)
def pure_func(arg1):
	# function on acts on input
	...
```

The `decorator` itself becomes a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-20-12-19-29-31000|Higher Order Function]] that provides the closure and context for the decorator function. Depending if the decorator is a generic function (`@decor`) or inherited from a class (`@SomeClass.decor`). 

We can also call this decorator as a ordinary function on other function:

## Decorator as classic Decorator Pattern

Classic OOP [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-25-46-85100|Decorator Pattern]] emphasises on the decorating of classes (*Class Wrapper*). Additional algorithms and context variables are within the class and access when the *interface method* is being called. Python's decorator simplifies the creation of pre-run logics:

```python
def decorator(fn: callable) -> callable:	
	def decorated_fn(*args):
		pre_run_logics()
		return fn(*args)	
	return decorated_fn
```

A classical approach can also be implemented by making the `decorator` as an class method: 

```python
class Decorator:
  @classmethod
  def pre_run_logics(cls):
    ...

  @classmethod
  def decorate(cls, fn: callable) -> callable:
    def decorated_fn(*args):
      cls.pre_run_logics()
      return fn(*args)	
    return decorated_fn

# usage
@Decorator.decorate
def fn():
	...
```

## Decorator as Context Manager

```python
def decorator(fn: callable) -> callable:
	context_kwd = change_fn_context()
	
	def decorated_fn(*args):
		return fn(*args, context_kwd)

	return decorated_fn
```

---
## Decorator as Registry

This emphasises on registering metadata about a function during runtime: 

```python
def decorator(fn: callable) -> callable:
	def decorated_fn(*args):
		return fn(*args)

	register_fn_metadata(...some_fn_metadata)

	return decorated_fn
```
