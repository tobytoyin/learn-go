# Encoder-Decorder Network 

*Encoder* & *Decoder* are Sequential Network Models that used to model sequence of data into predictions.

---
## Encoder

Encoder is a "*sequence-to-vector*" model: 
- input - sequences of vectors
- output - a single prediction vector

> [!Example]- Next Day Stock Prediction
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230204222026.png|500]]
> Let's consider Stock Price Prediction. On a single day, it can contains a feature vector (e.g., close, open, highest, lowest price of the day);  the sequencial input is the feature vector of multiple days. The model is trained and use predict a single value, i.e., the stock price of next day.

## Decoder

Decoder is a "*vector-to-sequence*" model: 
- input - a single vector
- output - a sequence of predictions

> [!Example]- Next N-Days Prediction
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230204223144.png|500]]
> Let's consider Stock Price Prediction again. The feature vector is still the same (e.g., close, open, highest, lowest price of the day) but we only provide the data of a single day. The model is trained and use to predict multiple days value.

## Encoder-Decoder

With just Encoder and Decoder alone, the capability is usually quite limited. The *Encoder-Decoder* model is similar to the original "*sequence-to-sequence*" model. But with the emphases on *learning the latent information*, then make predictions; rather than directly making predictions based on sequence of inputs. 

- Encoder - is the first part of the model which takes the sequencial input data and generate an output as latent vector
- Decoder - is the second part of the model which takes the latent vector as input and generate an output of prediction sequence

### Latent Information Learning

The Encoder-Decoder is often interpreted as a way to learn and represent the information as vectors: 
- Encoder - is to learn the information from input data
- Encoder Output Vector - is often called *latent representation/ vector*, which represents the most useful information from the sequence in a form of vector
- Decoder - is to use & make prediction based on information that is learnt (i.e., the latent vector)

> [!Example]- Next N-Days Predictions 
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230204225829.png|500]]
> Using our Stock Price Predictions again, Encoder-Decoder model is common use for this kind of forecasts because the model is not limited to just making 1 day forecast at a time. 
> The input again is a sequence of feature vectors of a stock of multiple days
> The Encoder first learn from this sequence to generate a latent vector, which could be representation of this stock movement pattern in general. 
> Since the model capture the "movement pattern" as a latent vector, the Decoder can use this as the input and predict the movement of stock for the next couple days.
