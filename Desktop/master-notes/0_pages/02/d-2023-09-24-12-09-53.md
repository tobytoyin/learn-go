## Coroutines doesn't run

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230701175924.png]]

Because a programme's runtime is only based on its Main Thread. A common problem with [[0_pages/03/d-2023-06-30-22-06-11|Coroutines]] not being executed is because the Main Thread is not being blocked/ paused and allow other Sub-Threads to run their Functions. Therefore, the programme ends its runtime and leaving Coroutines incomplete.

This is due to the Await Function operating on the Sub-Thread is taking too long to completed. Such that the Main Thread has exceed the blocking duration and the runtime has already ended and killing the Sub-Threads unexpectedly.
