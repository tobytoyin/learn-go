In Go, *Type Embedding* is an approach to allow struct to be constructed as composition but behaves and access attribute like [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800#Inheritance Design ("IS-A" relationship)|inheritance]]. 

This approach allows the composited object to extend and "inherit" its fields to the super struct. Proving a more convenient way to do composition without maintaining various of imports.

## Constructing Embedded Type

```go
type Person struct {
	name string
}

func (p *Person) sayName() {
	println("My name is", p.name)
}

type Child struct {
	// a Child embed a Person
	// and expand its method
	Person
	school string
}

```

## Initialisation

### Initialise by defaults & assign later
This method takes more lines of codes but **completely removing the explicit import** of the type `Person`. This is beneficial as a [[0_pages/02/d-2023-09-28-21-26-45|dependency inversion]] when the embedded type needs to be masked away, or reduce some awkward import of modules.
```go
// init with default values, then assign value
namelessChild := new(Child) 
namedlessChild.name = "john doe"
namedlessChild.sayName()
```

### Initialise by input arguments
This method is more explicit on the type embedding relationship. But sacrifice the benefit of dependency inversion: 

```go
namedChild := &Child{Person: Person{"timmy jr"}}
namedChild.sayName()
```

## Benefits of Dependency Inversion

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230625233659.png]]

The benefit of Type Embedding is that `main` entry point has a more straightforward dependency by inverting all the composition-struct into the type embedding struct.

Not using embedded type struct (left), this would creates lot of unnecessary dependencies across different modules. 

Using embedded type struct (right), all the dependency that needs to perform composition can be inverted and maintain within a single module.
