## Why EMR?

Implementing a data lake/ [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-06-00-01-12|Why Data Warehouse?]] application on our own involves lots of moving pieces and often has lots of complication in deploying and scaling. EMR can simplify areas related to big data processing:

- **Cluster Platform** 
	- simplify the setup of infrastructure & network for [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|Cluster of Machines]] 
	- simplify cluster fault tolerant and failure handling
- **Services Orchestration** 
	- simplify the implementation, orchestration, scaling of computing (Spark) and [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-33-82100|storage]] ([[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-25-52-87800|HDFS]]) resources 
	- S3 makes it easier to deploy and run multiple cluster-based application that share the same data sources efficiently
	- easier to integrate cluster's Nodes with various AWS services & functionalities
- **Data Consumption**
	- Running Spark in AWS makes it easier to consume processed data, i.e., easier access to AWS data storage from other AWS analytics services
- **Logging & Monitoring**
	- Simply logging and error tracing system since everything are centralised in [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-20-22-19-07|CloudWatch]]
