A large programme are often composited by many different small and independent functions. Instead of executing independent functions sequentially, this can be done separately simultaneously ([[0_pages/03/d-2023-06-30-22-06-11|Concurrency]]).

## Goroutines

Concurrency in Go are executed by *Goroutines*. A concurrent function would: 
1. execute a function `go func()` immediately without waiting for its completion
2. if the results of the concurrent function need to be gathered, we implement a *blocking function* to wait for its completion

> [!Tip]- async/ await
> Similar to Python/ Javascript: 
> - `go Func()` - is the `async` function that runs concurrently
> - `BlockFunc()` is the `await` function that wait for the results return

Goroutnes provide a simpler approach to compose asynchronous functions because we only need to concern which function needs to be run concurrency; while all non-async functions are implicitly awaiting functions. 

### Example:

This concurrency programme can be visualised in this way: 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230701134801.png]]

- two functions `AsyncPrintNumbers` and `AwaitBlockFunction` are executed simultaneously
- `AsyncPrintNumbers()` would execute print number using another Thread
- `AwaitBlockFunction()` would block the Go runtime on the Main Thread
	- then use `sleep` to switch Goroutine's Thread as Main Thread

```go
// this is an async function
func AsyncPrintNumbers(n int) {
	for i := 0; i < n+1; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i, "/", n)
	}
}

//this is a await function 
func AwaitBlockFunction() {
	fmt.Println("do something else.")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)   // put Main Thread on hold
	fmt.Println("end something else.")
}
```

This `AsyncPrintNumbers` are functions that would be run under concurrent mode, while `AwaitBlockFunction` aims to keep the Main Thread & Go programme alive: 

```go 
func main() {
	// this are execute and NOT wait for the return result
	go AsyncPrintNumbers(5) 

	// add a blockingg function to wait for concurrency to complete
	AwaitBlockFunction()
}

// >>
// do something else.
// 0 / 5
// 1 / 5
// 2 / 5
// 3 / 5
// 4 / 5
// 5 / 5
// end something else.
```
