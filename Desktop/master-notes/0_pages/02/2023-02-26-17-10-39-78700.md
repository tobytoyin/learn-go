## What is Snowflake? 

Snowflake is a platform that provides a set of technologies and integration to solve some of the common businesses' data management problems: 
- [[#🔩 Data Engineering & ETL]]
- [[#🫙 Data Silo Problems]]
- [[#☁ Traditional Infrastructure]]

## 🫙 Data Silo Problems

[[0_pages/02/d-2023-08-01-12-03-31|Data silos in organisations]] make large scale & features rich data analytics + data sharing difficult. Snowflake aims to allow different integration tools to bring into all datasets into a single platform, i.e., data warehouse. 

Unlike traditional databases, which can only allow unions of datasets (tables) when hosting under the same database. Snowflakes uses "[[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-04-27-31600#Compute (Virtual Warehouse) Layer|virtual data warehouses]]" ([[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-06-00-01-12|Why Data Warehouse?]] + [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-09-32-97200|Distributed System]]), so that **different databases that are presences in Snowflake platform can brew together using SQL-like language**.

## 🔩 Data Engineering & ETL 

It is about making data engineering tasks more business friendly and more accessible to non-technical users. So that ETL pipelines can be developed and used quickly. 

---
## ☁ Traditional Infrastructure

Unlike traditional databases, which required complex connections to communicate with a database's server. Snowflake is a "cloud oriented" technology, which can be easily integrated into different cloud providers. ==This makes it easy for organisations apply their Snowflake's data on different cloud providers' technologies & services==. 


> [!Tip]- Example in Querying
> For example, traditional databases make it difficult to query and join two tables from different databases. With Snowflake, this become possible:
> ```SQL
> SELECT *
> FROM db1.table1
> JOIN db2.table2 USING someKey
> ```
