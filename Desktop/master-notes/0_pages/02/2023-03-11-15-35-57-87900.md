# K8s Spec 

## `spec` for `kind`

![[1_catalog/14/2022-12-30-21-46#^4550b5]]

`spec` is the details for a specific [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-24-34-92400|K8s Resource]] (`kind`) in a API call. It declares what needs to be done/ created for a specific resource in a cluster. As different resources require different information, `spec` keys are different based on what `kind` is provided. 

> [!Tip]
> Eqv `spec` is the request (`kind`) schema that is accepted by the K8s API

## Finding the Spec

We can find the ==supported manifest keywords== of a `kind` by using: 

```shell
kubectl explain <<kind>> --recursive
```

>[!example]- CLI  Example
>For example we can examine some of the `spec` of `kind: services` by the below command line. This will show us what YAML specifications are allowed to create a Service.

If we need to look for a more specific information of the `spec`, can use: 

```shell
kubectl explain <<kind>>.spec
```

We can further access more information about the `<<kind>>.spec` Object by accessing the allowed keywords:
