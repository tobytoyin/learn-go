*Elastic Compute Service* (EC2) is ==cloud virtual machine that allow users to connect into it and use it==. 
This is like a "personal computer" but that is hosted in the cloud and its physical hardware is provisioned in some AWS data centres. We can use it just like how we interact with our physical computers. ^ca1378

## When to use EC2?

There are several factors in choosing to setup our own EC2 machines rather than using other AWS solutions: 

- deploying application with well-defined configuration and launch scripts
- high customisation that are not provided by managed AWS services
- experimentation on choosing optimal provisions (e.g., hardwares)

## AWS AMI

Amazon Machine Image ([[0_pages/03/d-2023-08-25-22-43-38|Specifications]]) is a hub where different provisions (hardware specifications & software configuration are stored). This includes what kinds of drives, OS, softwares to pre-installed when booting up an EC2. 

One would need to choose different specification from AMI based on their needs. For example, for instances that needs to train Machine Learning Models, one might need to choose AMI that is computing-intensive (better CPU); or some needs to use it store data might need a storage-intensive AMI (larger disk size).

> [!note]- AMI & Container
> Launching EC2 from AMI is similar to Containers. That it needs to be initialised by copying an Image and setup containers in a machine.

## 🔄 Lifecycle

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231109230744.png]]

An EC2 has the above Lifecycle from start to finish: 
1. Instances are spawned by copying the Image from AMI
2. *cold stage* - machine is pending, booting, and installing all the system packages
3. *hot stage* - machine is in "running" and being used. Data are stored as "in-memory" in the *instance store*
4. *warm stage* - machine has been stopped but the image has completed built
	- "Stop" - like a machine being shut down, instance store data are gone 
	- "Stop-Hibernate" - like the "sleep" mode, instance store data are preserved
5. terminating the instance - completely erase the instance

## 💰 Pricing

EC2 is charged based on the **billable hours at Hot and Warm Stage**. These stages are billable because the physical machine at AWS data centre are occupied by the account.  

There are several pricing models for EC2 with various commitments and discounts. 

| Pricing Model | Stability | Discount | Use Cases | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Spot Instances | Low & based on unused instances | Highest | Services that can be interrupted, e.g., CI/CD | 
| Reserved Instances | High & paid by years of commitment | Yes | 24/7 services, e.g., hosting web-app | 
| On-Demand Instances | High & paid by usage | No | App that allows some downtime |
