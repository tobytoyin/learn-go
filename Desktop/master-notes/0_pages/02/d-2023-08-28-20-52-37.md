*AWS Control Tower* is a managed services to govern multiple AWS organisation accounts and ensure that **different accounts under the same AWS account follow the same compliances & governances practices**. 

Essentially, this allows AWS organisation to be **created and managed under a "hierarchical structure"** to keep different AWS accounts governances consistent.

## Landing Zone

A *Landing Zone* is a container to wrap around all the AWS accounts into one AWS organisation. This allows: 
- the root account to have visibility on all the different accounts, resources created within the AWS organisation
- to spawn more organisational units (*OU*) under the same organisation when needed


---
## Controls

Control (*Guardrail*) is a high-level rule that controls and limits the governance boundary of different OU under the same AWS org: 

This provides guidances & restrictions for resources under different accounts: 
- mandatory - must-do policies, e.g., must attach to defined VPC for resources
- strong recommended - policies that should be followed, e.g., secrets in SM should have rotation
- elective - flexible basis, e.g., bucket can open to public if needed
