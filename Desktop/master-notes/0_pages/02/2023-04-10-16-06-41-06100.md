A programme is pretty much useless when it doesn't have capability to mutate variable's (global) state and *global variables* are often an unsafe way to mutate states. 

*Pointer* - as a term for "the memory address of a variable". 

It is a safer way to variables' states mutation in a programme because this makes state variables traceable in a programme. This is commonly used when dealing with: 
- global variables - to reference a value without passing it around in different context
- [[0_pages/02/2023-04-15-14-55-46-43900|struct]] - to save memory without excessive copying the entire object

## Pointers and Address

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230625185708.png]]

In Go, the syntax of pointers:
- `&` indicates an *address reference* and allow a variable to reference the actual object allocated to a specific memory address:
	- `&variable` is an address of a declared variable
	- `new(type)` is an address of an newly initialised `type` variable

- `*` indicates an *values access* and allow variable to access (modify/ copy) the actual values of the memory object
	- `*variablePtr` is to access actual values of a declared Pointer

> One way to think about Address (`&`) and Accessor (`*`) is: 
> - Address is the connection/ link between Memory & Variable
> - Accessor is the flow within that connection 
>In order to access (`*`) the Pointer's values, we need the Pointer address (`&`) to bind that connection between memory and variable.

## Variable Initialisation & Usages

```go
// initialise new copy of data
var x int  // default value (i.e., 0)
x := 100   // assign value
```

```go
xPtr := new(int)  // default Pointer of value 
```

### Conversion between Pointer and Copy

```go
x := 100  // create a variable

xPtr := &x  // assign Pointer of a variable
xCopy := *xPtr  // access the value and copy to a new variable
*xPtr = 500  // access the value and modify to a new value
```
