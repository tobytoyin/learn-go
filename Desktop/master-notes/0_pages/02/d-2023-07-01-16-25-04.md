## Threads & CallStack

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230701163544.png]]

When creating a programme, it is generally defining how a computer should queue and run the codes. The process that handles the execution is called a *Thread* and each programme commonly maintains its runtime based on a single *Main Thread*. 

Each Thread comes with its own queue (*CallStack*) indicating the execution order of each *Function*. When a programme is run: 
1. CPU resource is allocated as the Main Thread for the programme
2. Functions are queued into the CallStack of the Main Thread
3. Main Thread starts to dequeue its CallStack and complete its process
4. Programme exits when Main Thread ends

## Thread's States & Lifecycle

Thread itself maintain a lifecycle and state information, so that the low-level programme can use it to plan the executions: 

- `NEW` - is when a new Thread is created
- `TERMINATED` - is when a Thread has clear its Stack and finishes the execution
- `RUNNABLE` - is when a Thread is either is "running", or "ready to run" for its queued executions
- `NON_RUNNABLE` - when a Thread is put on-hold for further actions:
	- `TIMED_WAITING` - Thread is paused and work on other things for time limit, then notify the programme when it is no longer in this state
	- `WAITING` - Thread is paused and work on other things without time limit
	- `BLOCKED` - Thread is paused and locked until it is being unlock again

## Executing Sequential Programmes

In a basic sequential programme, the CallStack is built based on how the script structures the Function. For example: 

```go
def main() {
	FuncA()
	FuncB()
	Func()
}
```

When a programme's process starts, it creates a Main Thread & its Main CallStack. Each of the Function in the script are queued sequentially into the CallStack and the Main Thread executing the Functions sequentially based on how they are queued in the Stack.
