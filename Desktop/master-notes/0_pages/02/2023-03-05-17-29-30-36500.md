## Replicating Pods




multiple Nodes to have the same configuration as a way to scale a system. In Kubernetes, a¬†_ReplicaSet_¬†is an abstraction of [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Pod]] to do this these are commonly defined in `spec.template` through [[0_pages/01/2023-03-11-15-36-13-23200|K8s YAML]].

K8s scale the cluster by changing the number of Pods to match the specification of  the [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300#üïπ Controller|cluster desired state]] through [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-09-12-28000|deployment]]. Since ReplicaSet is based on the Pod, if there are new containers/ new images in a Pod, this would generate a new ReplicaSet (as a new version).

## Scaling Pods with Service

An ReplicaSet can also be applied to scale up a distributed [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|services]]. This relies on having a ReplicaSet that contains Pod with certain [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500#Labels & LabelSelector|label]], so when new Pods are being deployed into the cluster, a Service would able to pick them up through the `selector`.

## LabelSelector in ReplicaSet

When writing a Deployment YAML, we need to provide a `selector` which indicates what Pod's label to select during deployment.

Creating `labels` and using `selector` in ReplicaSet are used in two ways: 
- **As Object Reference** - 
	- `selector.matchLabels.app` are used to find the Pods that contains the matched `labels`, so that replication can copy the specification of the labelled Pods.
	- This is like referencing "variables" if considering Pod's spec an YAML object
- **As Service Reference**
	- since ReplicaSet matched and find the labelled Pods, this allows new Pods to inherit the same `labels`
	- Service would able to connect new Pods as well (see [[#Scaling Pods with Service]])
