Why do we need a [[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-29-17-06-35|Broker]] [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-29-17-10-21|Pub-Sub System]] to handle event streaming? A Broker Pub-Sub System aims to

## Stage 1 - Application Extending

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230711231646.png]]

When an application just started off, this might have just couple of different Services. For example, if each Service is streaming log events, the most straight-forward approach is to use a *[[0_pages/02/d-2023-10-29-17-03-40|point-to-point connections]]*, which pushes Events directly to an Event Processing Service. 

However this would create a technical debt when the application keeps scaling:
- adding new Services
- adding replication of existing Services
- adding new Event Processors 

Either way, a direct messaging system would become difficult to maintain and inefficient because: 
- each (new) Service would need to send the same Event multiple times for different Event Processors
- each Service and Processors would have a direct dependency to receive the events stream

## Stage 2 - Adding a simple Broker

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230711233340.png]]

This design can evolve and improve by adding a centralise layer that receives and store all the Events streamed by different Services (as Sender) and different Event Processors only need to query against the Broker to retrieve the Events required. 

This improves on these aspects: 
- reduce redundant events streaming, i.e., sending multiple copies of the same event to different Event Processors
- [[0_pages/02/d-2023-09-28-21-26-45|decouple the dependency]] between Sending Services and Event Processors, i.e., New Services only need to attach new event stream to the Broker; New Processors only need to query from the Broker

## Stage 3 - Organising Brokers by Context

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230711233406.png]]

To further improve on the Broker System, each Event Stream can maintain its own Broker System based on its context (i.e., *Topic*). For example, Events that related to transactions and users-interactions belong to different Topics' brokers. 

This improves on these aspects: 
- reduce the workload of a single Broker system, i.e., Processors dependent on relevant Brokers by the context instead of relying on heavy querying
- Broker system use fewer resources without running a monolith database
