## Mutation Type

*Mutation Type Schema* is a different kind of query schema, which describes: 
- the endpoints that are exposed for write/ update operations
- what parameters are accepted by each Endpoint
- what [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-19-16-10-50|Object Type]]/ Values are returned from each Endpoint after write/ updates

> [!Tip]
> A Mutation endpoint in GraphQL is similar to POST/ UPDATE endpoints in REST. Both are responsible for writing/ updating data in the backend.

```graphql
type Mutation {
	writeRecord(content: String!): Record!
	updateRecord(recordId: ID!, content: String!): Record!
}
```

In this `Mutation` schema, this contains two endpoints:
- `writeRecord` - writes a new `Record` with input `content`
- `updateRecord` - update an `Record` (matches with `recordId`) with input `content`
