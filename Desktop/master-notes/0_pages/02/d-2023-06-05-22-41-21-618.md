AWS provides two types of VPC's bounded firewalls to protect VPC's network:
- *network access control list* (ACL) - is a firewall at the subnet's level
- *security groups* - is a firewall at the instance's level

Both of these provide controls over what traffics are allowed to enter (*inbound*) and leave (*outbound*) to the Internet within a VPC.

## Network ACL

When internet traffics are allowed to flow in-out the VPC's subnets, Network ACL provides a **fine grind rules to check what kinds of traffics** are permitted (e.g., IP addresses, protocols, etc) to enter the Subnets. 

### Black lists

A default Network ACL uses a *black lists* (deny lists) to check all kinds of traffics and allow all traffics unless specifically "deny" it. 
A custom NACL uses a *white list* (allow list) to check traffics and deny all traffics unless specifically "allow" it. 

List can be changed as below: 
- allowed inbound rules - matched traffics can enter the subnet
- denied inbound rules - matched traffics cannot enter the subnet
- allowed outbound rules
- denied outbound rules

### Stateless Security
ACL is a *stateless* firewall, which means all the inbound & outbound are checked against the list regardless where the traffics are originated. 

This means network traffics could stuck inside the subnets when rules are configured to the inbound list but not to the outbound list.

## EC2 Security Group

*Security Group* is the last firewall bounded around a EC2 instance. It generally controls the inbound traffics that can enter the EC2 instance's network. **By default, all outbound traffics are allowed to exit EC2**. 

### Whitelist 

Security group is based on *allow list* only, which only allow traffics that match the allow rules to enter the instance: 
- allowed inbound rules - matched traffics can enter the instance
- (optional) allowed outbound rules - matched traffics can leave the instance

### Stateful Security
Security is a *stateful* firewall, which means it stores temporary information on where traffics are originated and how it was being allowed. 

For example, if an inbound traffics is originated outside of the instance and entered the instance, it is state information that allows it to leave.

> If configured incorrectly, a ACL can allow traffics into subnet but security group blocks the traffics into the EC2 instance.
