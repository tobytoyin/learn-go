## Secured Network Connections

This models the network connections between on-premises server to cloud server:
### On-premise → Cloud Solutions
- [[d-2023-08-29-14-31-49|AWS PrivateLink]] - (private network) on-premise to VPCs connections via only service endpoint provided by AWS
- [[AWS Direct Connect]] - (private network) bring the entire AWS network to on-premise via physical *Dedicated Network Connections*. This is similar to PrivateLink but higher bandwidth and lower latency
- [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-12-23-36-33|AWS VPN]] - (public network) on-premise to a single VPC via encrypted traffics

### Cloud → On-premise Solutions
- [[0_pages/04/d-2023-08-25-14-03-44#Private Outbound Traffics|Transit Gateways]] - (private network) multiple VPCs connect to on-premise networks with a single Gateway
- [[0_pages/02/d-2023-08-25-13-48-52|AWS VPN Cloud Hub]] - (public network) single VPC connection to multiple on-premise networks
- [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-12-23-36-33|AWS VPN]] - (public network) single VPC encrypted connection to a single on-premise network

### Cloud → Cloud Solutions
- [[d-2023-08-29-14-31-49|AWS PrivateLink]] - (private network) VPCs to VPCs via connections via only service endpoint provided by AWS
- [[0_pages/04/d-2023-08-25-14-03-44#Private Outbound Traffics|Transit Gateways]] - (private network) multiple VPCs to VPCs via network connections 
- [[d-2023-10-13-21-49-06|AWS Network Firewall]] - (public network) managed secured network connections without changing existing network infrastructure
