## Cloud Services Layer 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20221127162512.png]]

The Cloud Services Layer in Snowflake can be considered as the "brain"/ "client" of the platform. It ==handles all the functionality requests== (e.g., SQL query, metastore, resources manager). 

For example: 
- SQL query requests are handled in this layer by optimising and how to query the data from multiple distributed databases. 
- Security features handles users' permission in access certain databases
- Managing where the clustered data are stored (metastore & [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|partitions]])

## Compute (Virtual Warehouse) Layer

A Snowflake *virtual warehouse* (`WAREHOUSE`) decouples the computation resources (CPU) from the central data storage (database). 

According to Snowflake's: 
> Warehouses are "workforces" -- they are used to perform the processing of data.¬†

Instead of having one powerful compute resource to handle a increasing-growing central storage, a **Warehouse allocates computation resources based on the storage-volume that needs to be processed/ staged**. 

This Warehouse of different sizes ([[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Cluster]] with different numbers of Nodes) that serve as a "staging system" that off loads the required data from the central storage into a temporary Warehouse's resources to enable process & querying.   

> [!note]- 
> Unlike [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-11-29-31400|Shared-Disk Architecture]] which centralised disks connection with all CPU, this essentially off loads data partitions into separate sets of Resource. We can think of this as the combination of the two:

## Centralised Storage Layer

Snowflake centralised storage are also called *Remote Disks* because it allows to the virtual warehouse to remotely connect to different cloud storages from different providers. It also builds on top with two major functionalities: 
- ***zero-copy cloning*** - create a snapshot of the database without storing additional copy of the data (similar to versioning)
- ***time-travel*** - allows the database to revert back to particular version or state
