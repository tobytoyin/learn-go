## User Group Policies

An *IAM Group* (User Group) is a convenient to manage multiple Users into access the a set of Resources. 
This is useful when managing a team of developers. Instead of adding individual Resources to each developer, we can setup an IAM Group that have the needed [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-11-22-57-32|IAM Policies]]. 

By adding new developers into the Group, it inherits all the Policies without having to define everything from scratch, or defines individuals Policies.
