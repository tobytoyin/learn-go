# Key Concepts (Avon 129)

- contains the "framework" of how the brain works. 
- takes up 70% of the human brain, which process sensory, knowledge, and coordinate information which leads to human intelligence

## How would the brain learns?

- The brain learns about the model of the environment. 
- A "Model" doesn't need to contain all the facts but just an abstraction of how different things work and coordinate together

## Reference Frame

This brings us to the "*Reference Frame*" of the brain: 
- the brain makes use of the ==relative information== that is learnt by the brain's model. 
- this is like a map of information. Instead of remembering everything by facts, the  Relative Frame recalls information relative to the model's components, making it like a "network"
- Information & Intelligence works as a "path searching" within the network: from one piece of information relative to another piece
