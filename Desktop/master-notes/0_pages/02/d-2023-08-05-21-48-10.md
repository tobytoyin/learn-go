A *Staging Storage* is a temporary storage to store loaded/ transformed data (or files) before permanently write into a Snowflake Table. Staging Objects are often used for: 
- aggregation window for streaming data
- temporary data awaiting to join with other data
- temporary files/ data awaiting for other operations

Unlike traditional ETL/ ELT system's [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-06-00-01-12#ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) System|staging database]], Snowflake uses [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-14-04-20-60100|Object Storage]] as a *Staging Storage* for its [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-04-27-31600|Warehouse's]] temporary storage.

## Internal vs External Stage Objects

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-08-05-23-48#^internal-external]]

When creating Staging Storage in a Snowflake Warehouse, you can choose between *Internal or External Staging Objects*: 
- Internal - **temporarily staged objects** within Snowflake Warehouse, staged objects are removed when Warehouse is offline
- External - **permanently staged objects** hosted on cloud providers, staged objects are post/ put to providers' managed services (e.g., [[0_pages/01/2023-08-26-12-30-04-74400|AWS S3]])

## Copying Into Permanently Storage

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-08-05-23-48#^file-format]]

When using a Staging Storage to temporary store files, Snowflake can use a defined [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-22-55-31-12300#File Format|File Format]] to the files into approach format, load the data, and copy into a permanent storage. We can copy the temporary objects into an existing Table using either list of file names or GLOB pattern. 

```sql 
--list of static filenames example 
COPY INTO <tableName>
FROM @<stagingObjectPrefix>
FILES = ( 'my-file.txt' )
FILE_FORMAT = ( format_name=<fileFormatName> );

-- using glob pattern example
COPY INTO <tableName>
FROM @<stagingObjectPrefix>
PATTERN = '*.txt'
FILE_FORMAT = ( format_name=<fileFormatName> );

```

---
## Query Staged Objects 

We can query staged objects as an in-memory Table after converting staging objects using File Formats. We pass additional arguments to the SQL Statement: 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM @<stagingObjectPrefix>
(FILE_FORMAT => <fileFormatName>)
```
