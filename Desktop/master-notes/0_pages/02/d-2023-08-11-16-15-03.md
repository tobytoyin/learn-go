Streamlit has a convient way to create quick application, this aims to make Streamlit components more align with good software design patterns and structure. 

The major problem with baseline Streamlit is that, when we need to debug or update some components. A poorly designed "script" is hard to trace on which components we need to make changes to.

## Design

We try to make Presentation Layers 

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st


class BaseComponent(ABC):
    def __init__(self, component: str, id: str = None, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__()
    
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        ...

class Component(BaseComponent):
    def __init__(self, component, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        self.callback = lambda: getattr(st, component)(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def render(self):
        return self.callback()
        
        
class StatefulComponent(Component):
    ...
    
    
class WrapperComponent(BaseComponent):
    def __init__(self, component, elements: List[Component]) -> None:
        self.component = getattr(st, component)
        self.elements = elements
        
    def add_after(self, id):
        # add component after certain widget's id
        ...
        
    def add_before(self, id):
        # add component before certain widget's id
        ...
        
    def add_pos(self, idx): 
        # add component at a certain position
        ...
        
    def render(self):
        if not self.elements:
            return 
        
        with self.component:
            [el.render() for el in self.elements]
        
```

The purpose of these classes are to delay the creation of streamlit Components in the web interface, i.e., by using `render()` to invoke the callback function for the streamlit objects.
