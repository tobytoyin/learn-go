# IAM Roles

*IAM Roles* is a temporary access credentials in AWS to allow it to perform Actions. In order words, it is granted by AWS to someone/ something to interact with AWS temporarily **without the need of having static AWS credentials**.

IAM Roles also **replace the existing Users' Permissions & credentials**, which can act as an temporary extensions of permissions. 

> [!Tip] Rule of Thumb
> IAM Roles are granted and live inside AWS Services to perform Actions on behalf of the Users

## Key Feature of IAM Role

- No static login credentials - users cannot directly login to an AWS account; and allow the use of of external identity providers
- "assumed" - allow services/ people to assume as an User and perform tasks
- temporary - credentials are temporary session, which would expire and rotate 
- as  "layering" to mask the actual Users to provide extra security
- extend Permissions to Users' restricted Users' permissions temporarily & removes when not needed

### User-AWS Interaction

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231031211553.png]]

For example, in an normal user-AWS interactions, users are authenticated and permitted to perform actions as an IAM User to interact with AWS. This process involves an actual **human-in-the-loop** (the IAM User): 

- authenticated - by login credentials
- authorised - what kind of actions are permitted to this User (IAM Policy)

## Role-based Interaction

IAM Roles are "*assumed*", this means someone or something can indirectly using a temporary user to make API requests. These Roles are "assumed" to be a AWS User through a session by using a "temporary token" provided by [[0_pages/04/d-2023-10-31-21-12-42|AWS STS]]. 

> [!NOTE]
> Someone - usually are users that login from non-AWS portal, these Roles are usually called *Federated Users*
> Something - are service's resource that needs to interact with AWS, these Roles are called *Assumed Roles*

The access process is also similar but taking out the IAM User from the loop and replaced it by a proxy (*IAM Role*). Assumed Role is similarly being: 

- authenticated - what is the source identity and can it assume a role? 
- authorised - what kind of actions are permitted to this role (IAM Policy)

## Trusted Policy

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230620100229.png]]

A *Trusted Policy* is policy defining "who & on what conditions can others assume an role". This commonly involves:
- having another IAM Identity (user, roles) to assume another Roles to extend permission
- change/ modify Roles within Resources

For example, a Lambda Resource has a default `lambda-role`, an additional Trusted Policy attach to this Resource could conditionally allow admin users to change the role in the Resource to `lambda-admin-role` to perform higher privilege tasks.
