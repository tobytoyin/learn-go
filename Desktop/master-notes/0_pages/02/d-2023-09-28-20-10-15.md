## Undo

- Undo until previous Commits
	- `git revert HEAD` - create a new commit to undo the last commit
	- `git reset --hard HEAD~` - undo the last commit by removing the commit
	- `git reset --soft HEAD~` - undo the last commit but keep it at staging (as if `git add` without commit)
- Undo a "cherry picked" commit
	- `git revert --strategy resolve <sha>`
- Undo the entire branch to a branch (e.g., Main)
	- `git reset --hard origin/main`


---
## Cleanup

- Remove untracked files 
	- `git clean -n` to dry run and see what files to remove
	- `git clean -f` to remove them
- Cleanup unused branches
	- `git branch --merged | grep -v \* | xargs git branch -D`
