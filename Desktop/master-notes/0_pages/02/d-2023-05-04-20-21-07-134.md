When developing applications in the cloud, one of the challenge is how that run/ test/ mock the application locally. 

*Localstack* is a containerised software that enumerates popular cloud services in our local machine, such that we can: 
- ensure that the local and deployment codes are similar (mocking env) 
- saves time/ cost to access mocked cloud resources
- test cloud services orchestration in a simpler and testable way

---
## Step 1 - Create a Project Environment

This setup is to mock AWS cloud Localstack. We structure our Project directory as:
```bash
.
├── .aws
├── docker
│   ├── .env
│   └── docker-compose.yml
├── home
└── start-localstack.sh
```
- `/.aws` - (optional) dummy AWS directory for configs & credentials to mount
- `/docker` - where the Docker files & environment variables are stored
- `/home` - our designated volume to mount, i.e., the Workspace/ root within the container
- `start-localstack.sh` - contains a simple docker-compose command

---
## Step 2 - Creating Docker File & Env File

Following the [Installation Guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#docker-compose), we create the docker-compose file: 

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "${LOCALSTACK_DOCKER_NAME-localstack_main}"
    image: localstack/localstack
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"            # LocalStack Gateway
      - "127.0.0.1:4510-4559:4510-4559"  # external services port range
    environment:
      - DEBUG=${DEBUG-}
      - DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    volumes:
      - "${LOCALSTACK_VOLUME_DIR:-./volume}:/var/lib/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```

We also define out env inside `.env` for dockerfile to reference when build. 

```yml
LOCALSTACK_VOLUME_DIR='./home'
LOCALSTACK_DOCKER_NAME='my-localstack'
```

---
## Step 3 - Start the Container

In `start-localstack.sh`, it scripts a command to save us some typing: 

```sh
# start the container
docker-compose \
    --env-file docker/.env \  # .env variables to use
    --project-directory . \   # set root to . instead /docker
    -f docker/docker-compose.yml \  # dockerfile location
    up
```

---
## Step 4 - Interact with "cloud" shell

Once the container started, we can interact with it using the terminal (or attach it as working directory in VSCode): 

```sh
# prompt into container shell
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
```

Then we create a dummy profile inside: 

```sh
awslocal configure --profile localstack  # create dummy profile

# after completion of the steps 
export AWS_PROFILE=localstack
awslocal configure list  # check the profile
```

---
## What we have so far?

After this, we have the following: 
- a local AWS host at `localhost:4566`
- a terminal that can mock AWS CLI using `awslocal`
