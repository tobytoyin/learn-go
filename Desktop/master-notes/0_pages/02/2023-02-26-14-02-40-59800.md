# AWS IAM 

AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) is a access management tool to **manage the authentication and authorise of identities in AWS**. 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230619173339.png]]

- *Identity Authentication* - the identity of the user who interacts (logins, actions, etc.) with AWS (who are you?) - [[0_pages/01/d-2023-06-16-17-32-37-649|IAM Identities]]
- *Access Authorisation* - the permissions of what kind of actions that identity can perform (what can you do?) - [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-11-22-57-32|IAM Policy]]

## IAM Users' Process Example

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230619173640.png]]

Other than validating logins & access, authentication identifies which type of user (*IAM User*) or which group of user (*IAM Groups*) the User belongs to.

## IAM Non-Users' Process

In AWS, interactions can be invoked by **entities without any Users' credentials** (e.g., 3rd login providers, AWS resources). This process follows the similar approach of Authentication and Authorisation process within IAM but substitute Users by the use of [[0_pages/02/d-2023-02-26-14-24-33|IAM Roles]].
