# Python - Single Dispatch 

*Single Dispatch* (`functools.singledispatch`) is a way to simplify a single function by "dispatching" it to multiple functions that act different based on different inputs' Types. The main goal for this is to **decouple function logics from type handling**.


---
## Why use Single Dispatch

Let's take an example function `make_number` that convert an input to an integer based on different input. 

### Anti-pattern Example

```python
def make_number(n: Union[str, float, int]) -> int:
    if isinstance(n, int):
        return n
    if isinstance(n, str):
        try:
            return int(n)
        except ValueError:
            return None
    if isinstance(n, float):
        return int(round(n))

    return None
```

This function has several disadvantages: 
- functional purpose is mixed with core logic (i.e., number conversion) and case-switching by types
- difficult to extend/ add logics and maintain - new extensions are added within the "if" nest, making it different to read

### Single Dispatch Example
```python
@singledispatch
def make_number(n) -> None:
    return None

@make_number.register
def make_number_int(n: int) -> int:
    return n

@make_number.register
def make_number_str(n: str) -> Option[int]:
    try:
        return int(n)
    except ValueError:
        return None

@make_number.register
def make_number_float(n: float) -> int:
    return int(round(n))
```

1. `make_number()` is the default `singledispatch` function, which is invoked when the input doesn't match any of the supported types. 
2. `register` extends the function based on the input's type, e.g., when input is `int` type, this is handled by `make_number_int()`, etc. 

Using single dispatch has several benefits:
- function is single purposed to execute only the logic without doing case-switch
- function is more maintainable without heavily nested logics on types handling
- multiple functions remain under the same namespace, i.e., **different logics under the same umbrella**

## Multiple Dispatch

Problem with `singledispatch` is that it only recognise the type of a first argument, hence the generic type can only match on the first input argument: 

For example, the second dispatch won't get match because only `a: int` would be matched in type checking:

```python
@func.register
def _(a: int, b: str):
	...

@fun.register
def _(a: int, b: List[str]): 
	...
```

In this case, we would need [multiple dispatch](https://pypi.org/project/multipledispatch/) from external library to allow generic type matching on all arguments.
