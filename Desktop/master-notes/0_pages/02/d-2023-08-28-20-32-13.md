*Fargate* is a serverless implementations of containerised applications in AWS, allowing the use of both: 
- [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-13-57-53600|ECS]] - serverless approach to scale containerised application
- [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-13-57-53600|EKS]] - serverless approach to scale [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Kubernetes cluster application]]

## Fargate vs ECS

Fargate and [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-13-57-53600#üéª Containers in EC2|ECS]] shares some similarity. 
- Both executes application by deploying containerised applications (i.e., images)
- capability to scale more/ fewer containers

### Differences

- ECS relies on running containers in servers hosted in EC2 instances, whereas **Fargate doesn't require users to manage EC2 instances' server** 
- ECS requires some scaling definitions in AWS, whereas **Fargate manages the scaling on containers to compute a task** by sacrificing with a lower compute resources limits
