   The author shows that no all dreams could help to lead to creative problem solving; finding “intuitive” solutions to problems. To make dreaming benefits problem solving, it needs these:
- [[#❓What kinds of details?|Supply the details of the problem/ experience]]
- [[#❓What kinds of contents to dream about?|Certain contents to dream about that would associate to the problem/ experience ]]

## ❓What kinds of details?

To allow dreaming to benefit us in finding the problem, we need to supply some details (information) during our awake time.

- **Relational based information**
	- Learn/ gather information based on connections. For example, “how different problems are related”.
	  “Dreaming” generally act as a way to discover new pathways among different information that we experienced awake, and walk through different “node” of ideas without following logical pathway like being awake.
	  By “supplying” explicit relational information during awake, our mind could jump ahead and discover some unbeknownst association among information that we fail to see awake.

- **Repetition of Problems**
	- This simply add more “mental footprint” different awake time, so that dreams could have better exposure to the problem.

## ❓What kinds of contents to dream about?

Dreams that benefit us to solve problems creatively are combined of the following:
-   the details of problems → re-picturing/ re-experiencing the problem we stuck at
-   -   pre-existing knowledge (semantic knowledge) that share similar/ relevant experience

## ❔ Dreaming Methods

-   **Thomas Edison**
	- He used napping time to dream and create a self-awaking mechanism to wake himself up at the moment of REM sleeping state (dreaming state). Taking advantage of the dreaming “shortcut thinking” mode, he writes down many different ideas.
The problem with “dreaming to benefit problem solving” is that - it is more about chances rather having an actual approach to induce us to dream more or dream something specific.

## 🔑 Keys

The key herein is that to make dreaming most beneficial to our problem at hand:
-   _think more_ → repetitions
-   _think deep_ → make connections & relations
-   _experience more_ → expand pre-existing knowledge
With these, dreaming allows the brain to find shortcuts to our problems.
