# MapReduce Indexing Documents 

One of the key use cases of Batch Processing is to use [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|MapReduce]] to create Document Index. This was Google initial use cases for using MapReduce to index different websites and create a *Term Dictionary* as their search engine's Search Index.

In this approach, what the ==Batch Processing System doing is a "Document in, Index out" approach==. This means Terms Search Index are created (re-created) when the Batch Processing System processes a bunch of websites (documents).
- The Batch Process process and partition different documents into a distributed storage and each partition would contain a Terms Index
- Terms Index would then allow Search Clients to quickly lookup what it is needed before retrieving the actual documents

## How MapReduce do this?

To store (partition) the documents and update the Terms Index in each partition independently, MapReduce can do this quite efficiently. 

![[1_catalog/14/2022-12-17-20-43#^333b31]]

During the Mapping Stage: 
- large amount of websites are processed as Records in MapReduce
- partition each documents by hash into a distributed file system
- Mapper preprocess documents, terms extraction etc for each Record

During the Reduce Stage: 
- aggregate useful scores (like TFIDF) for terms extracted in a partition
- generate a Terms Index (or Terms Dictionary) for each Reducer partition

Search Clients: 
- [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-41-40-19700|query are searched]] against the Terms Index of different partitions
- recommend a list of documents (websites) retrieve from partitions
