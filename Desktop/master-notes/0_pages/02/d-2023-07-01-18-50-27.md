An *Event Queue Programme* indicates a special type of [[0_pages/03/d-2023-06-30-22-06-11#Async-Await Programme|Async Await Programme]]. Instead of having a limited Thread Blocking duration for an Await Function, the Main Thread is responsible to be hosting a background *Event Listener* with an infinite Blocking duration as *Event Loop*. 

When a new event/ stream of events is received, the Event Listener's Thread is paused and switch to process the Event.
