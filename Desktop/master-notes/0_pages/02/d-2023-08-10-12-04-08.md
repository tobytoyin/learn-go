## Multi-AZ Hosting

When planning for disaster in AWS (e.g., service unavailable in an AZ), the basic approach is to host replicate resources [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-02-06-51200#Fault Tolerance|in at least two AZs]]. For example: 
- hosting two RDS in multiple AZ to ensure high availability


---
## Multi-Region Replica

For more secured disaster planning, resources can be replicated across multiple Regions. This ensures that even a single Region (all AZs in the region) becomes available, resources can still be accessed in a different Region. E.g.: 

- RDS replica in another Region and promotes read operation in the Replicated RDS when disaster happens in main Region ([[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-38-17-65500|see Leaderless Replication]])
