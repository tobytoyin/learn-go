*Github Actions* is a CI/ CD tool that runs workflow automation based on events that happen in a Github repository (e.g. pull requests, merge, etc.).

This is useful when an application hosted in Github needs some: 
- automatically runs test cases in PR
- automatically updates metadata in a database when merging branch
- etc...

## Basic Architecture

1. Github Event (e.g., a PR) triggers and start a *Workflow* 
2. Workflow consists of multiple *Task Runners*: 
	- these can be thought as independent Tasks that need to be executed, e.g., run tests, run security checks etc..
3. Each Runner composes of a single *Job*
	- this is equivalent to starting up a virtual server through container
	- this server is used to run shell script, CLI, applications as to complete the Task (these are *Steps*)
	- data/ env vars generate within a single Job can be shared among different Steps of the Job
4. *Steps* are actions that we need to complete for a particular Job, these can be: 
	- custom shell script that runs CLI operations
	- "Actions" that run a custom application & codes (this can be 3rd party applications/ custom built applications)
