# Snowflake Storage Objects 

There are different types of *Snowflake Storage Objects*, each with their own pre-defined structure and functionality. Each Storage Object is mainly used for a specific purpose. 

---

## 💽 Database Object

> [!note]- Database Meaning 
> A "database" doesn't necessarily mean an relational database. Anything that stores information can be regarded as a database. 

A Snowflake **Database is like an organisational unit** (like a file system) that operates on top of a [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-04-27-31600#Compute (Virtual Warehouse) Layer|computation layer]] (virtual warehouse). It is the top-level storage organiser for various kinds of information, for example, tables for a relational database, different use-ready functions (User Defined Functions) for our data. 

--- 
## 🏛️ Schema Object

A *Snowflake Schema* is a **secondary level organisational unit** (like a sub-dir in a file system) to organise different objects. This allows other objects (like views, tables) be allocated at a particular location,

It is **useful to store objects dependency under a Schema**. For example, we can use Schema to organise dependency such as: 
- set of Tables that are related 
- set of Views that derive from a set of Tables
- set of Tasks/ UDF that are used to CRUD Tables
- set of resource objects that is supporting an application's layer

![[3_hidden/_images/database-object-20221203171610.png|500]]

Every Database also comes with two pre-defined Schema:
- `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` - contains the metadata of all objects within this Database as Views (e.g.,  list of tables, columns of tables, etc.)
- `PUBLIC` - is the default custom Schema for organising database objects.

## 🗓️ Table Objects

There are several types of Tables in Snowflake: 

- *Persistent Tables*
	- basic type of Table, which stores the latest state of the data
	- persist "infinitely" until deleted
- *Transient Tables*
	- similar to Persistent Table but with lower level of data protection, e.g., no data recovery protection after retention period
- *Temporary (Stage) Tables*
	- table survives within a session and mainly used for staging data in a ETL process
- *External Tables*
	- mainly used to query files (CSV, parquet) without setting a database
	- also can integrate with data lake technologies like [[0_pages/04/2023-03-11-15-35-31-07000|Apache Hive]]
- *Materialised Tables* ^47272f
	- an event based Table, which automatically create a snapshot/ copy of the data when a transformation event occurred 
	- e.g., streaming data are processed and immediately refresh the Table

---
## 🌁 View Objects

*Views* represents a virtual table represented by query statements. It is virtual because no data are separated stored for Views and only get computed when "view query" is executed. 

There are two types of Views:
- **Materialised Views**
	- dynamically refreshed and updates when Table gets modified
- **Non-materialised Views**
	- standard view and static unless being re-executed

---
## UDF & Stored Procedures Objects

Both of these allow engineers to develop their own custom logics to return a Table or Values as a standalone object. 

- **UDF (User Defined Functions)**
	- a custom function written in other programming languages 
	- this can be used later on other query (like how we `COUNT()` in SQL)
- **[[0_pages/01/d-2023-10-11-17-41-49|Stored Procedure]]** ^2538e3
	- it is a piece of "stored script" in a specific programming language
	- in snowflake, this is a piece of ETL programme with *serverless computing* stored in part of the Snowflake account

---
## Stream Objects

Unlike [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-05-18-97000#^47272f|materialised Table or Views]], which automatically refresh the whole tabular data when receiving UPSERT. A "*Stream Object*" only stores the change set (delta) logs from a Table's state.

---
## Task Objects

Snowflake "Task" is a way to automate & scheduled certain SQL jobs. This is useful in both Batch Processing and Streaming.

> [!example]- Batch Processing Tasks
> We could use Tasks to schedule SQL to aggregate one Table (usually transaction data) and ingest it into another Table by a daily schedule.

> [!example]- Stream Processing Tasks
> We could use Tasks to schedule SQL to ingest data as a Streaming Window. For example, a [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-05-18-97000#Stream Objects|Stream Object]] is used as a Staging Table to store all the transaction within a window of time. Then a Task is used to aggregate into some other Table.
