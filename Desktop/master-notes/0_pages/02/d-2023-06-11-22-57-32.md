# Authorisation Policies 

*Authorisations* in AWS can be defined in two areas: 
- *Identity-based Policy* - permissions that are defined on the Identity side ([[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-14-02-40-59800|IAM]])
- *Resource-based Policy* - permission that are defined on the service's resource

These permissions are defined by attaching a *Policy Statement* onto IAM/ Resources, which checks the permission whether an Entity can perform: 
- `Effect` - `Allow` or `Deny` to perform certain Action
- `Action` - something that an AWS service can perform
- `Resource` - a subset of Resource created under an AWS service
- `Principal` - is the source identity that requests to perform certain Action

## AWS Authorisation Model

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230616132639.png]]

When User accesses AWS Resources, it is making API Requests to Resources to perform Actions. The Resource itself contains an [[0_pages/04/d-2023-05-30-22-13-00-635|API Gateway]] to check if those Requests is permitted and hence allow/ reject Actions. 

- AWS identity would perform API request towards a target resource
- the identity request (outbound request) is checked whether it can reach to the other resource (*explicit identity based permission*)
- the resource (inbound request) checks if the request is permitted to be performed (*explicit resource based permission*)

## Identity-based Policy

*Identity-based Policy* (often as *IAM Policy*) is **permission attached to IAM identities** end (user, user group, role). Policies are checked at first on the outbound request before reaching to AWS resources, i.e., whether the initial service requests can be sent out or not. 

The purpose of this is to validate whether the "person" requesting the actions is permitted to do so in IAM.  

> [!Tip] Policy Statement
> "Someone" is `<Effect>` to perform `<Action>` on `<Resource>`.
> e.g.,  I (Role) am `Allow` to perform `GetObject` on `s3`.

For example, a User Policy is attached to a User: 
- "allow" Actions on Resource B
- "deny"/ missing Actions on Resource A
When the User trying to make action requests: it will allow to perform the allowed actions on Resource B but not on Resource A


---
## Resource-based Policy

*Resource-based Policy* is **permission attached to Resources** end (S3, Lambda, etc). Policies are checked when there's a inbound service request sent by another AWS entity (*Principal*), i.e., whether the service request can be performed or not. 

> [!Tip] Policy Statement
> `<Principal>` is `<Effect>` to ask "me" to perform `<Action>` on `<Resource>`.
> e.g., `lambda-123` is `Allow` to ask "me" to perform `putObject` on `s3`

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230616133015.png]]

For example, a Resource Policy is attached to a Resource, when processing incoming service requests:
- Role 1 is "deny"/ missing Actions to be performed on Resource → "not perform"
- Role 2 is "allow" Actions to be performed on Resource → "perform"
