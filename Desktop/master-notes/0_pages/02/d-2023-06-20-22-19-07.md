*AWS CloudWatch* is a centralised service to monitor all the loggings and metrics within AWS and its resources. For example: 
- S3 - objects size; requests
- Lambda - runtime durations; log/ print of codes
- EC2 - instance utilisation; requests rate

## How to Use CloudWatch?

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230621150952.png]]

When AWS Services and Resources are setup, their logs and infrastructure metrics are collected into CloudWatch organised by *Dimensions*. 

> [!Tip]- Monitor Dimensions
> "Dimensions" are key-value data to provide more context of how/ where the monitoring informations are generated. For example, `instanceId` on which specific EC2 instance the logs/ metrics are for

### Data Aspects
- *Log Files* - provide a centralised place to few all the logger print statements 
- *Metrics* - aggregated statistics of Resources over a period of time (5 mins by default). Metrics include:
	- predefined - metrics on the data collected on Resource-level
	- custom - application-level metrics defined collected the application

### Functional Aspects
There are some key functionality that are based on logs & metrics:
- *Dashboard* - use dashboards to summarise and monitor key metrics selected
- *Log Insights* - analyses & querying of log data to provide gain insights 
- *Events* - **rule-based triggers** that can start other targeted AWS Resources :
	- *time-based* - CRON base events, e.g., launch more compute instances at a specific "peak" hours
	- *event-based* - based upon Rules on incoming logs/ API logs on CloudTrails
- *Alarms* - **metric-based triggers** that can start predefined CloudWatch Actions:
	- *threshold & trend based* - passing a metric's threshold would trigger Alarms 
	- *changes & states based* - observing the states/ changes of Resources to trigger Alarms


> [!Tips]- Events vs Alarms
> - Events are mainly based on schedules/ rules and it is reacting to a "single CloudWatch event"; it can also start applications on other services that involve more complex workflow, e.g., invoking a Lambda for rollback operations.
>
> - Alarms are based on observing on and reacting to a "stream of CloudWatch metrics" over time (thresholds & trend). It only starts Actions that are already defined within CloudWatch (e.g., SNS notification, EC2 Scaling, etc.). These Actions are more simple and single purpose but commonly used.

## Structure of Logs

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230621145606.png]]

Logs in CloudWatch is grouped by three levels: 
- *Log Groups* - are a set of Resources' logs that group together, i.e., under the same AWS Service, this can have multiple log groups (usually define by `service/app-stack`) 
- *Log Events* - are events that logs are related to. e.g., Lambda are usually grouped into a single "function lifecycle" event, or [[0_pages/02/d-2023-11-07-20-55-47|EC2 Lifecycle]]
- *Log Stream* - the logs (terminal printout) in chronological order
