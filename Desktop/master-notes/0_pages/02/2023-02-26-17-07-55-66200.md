## Problem Statement

- predict COVID cases in US (from Feb 2023 to Jun 2023)
- Existing approaches focuses mainly on a single aspect in model transmission
	- *mechanistic approach* - using pre-defined transmission parameters (like rates)  
	- *time-series approach* - using only observed pattern to replicate new trends
- aim to explore using [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-17-06-30-81300|GNN]] along with [[time series]] to model
	- includes human mobility (location & neighbours) in modelling transmission

## Dataset

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230222213333.png]]
- a master dataset consists of: 
	- Nodes Features - using COVID data & aggregated mobility Google data
	- Edge Features - using Google mobility data (inflow & outflow among counties)
	- mobilities to form Edges (Nodes connections)

## Training Data

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230222221651.png]]
One training data composes of 2 aspects: 
1. time-series (7 days data) concatenated together as *Temporal Graph*
2. Prediction Node & its neighbours form a network as *Spatial Graph*

### Subgraph Extraction

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230222223036.png|400]]

-   Full graph is large & not everything are important
-   sub-graph ‚Üí a smaller input to capture potentially ‚Äúimportant‚Äù info.
-   using ‚Äúlinks‚Äô net-inflow feature‚Äù as weight ‚Üí find top neighbours

## Model Architecture

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230222224638.png]]

Model is learnt under 2 pathways: 
- *Temporal Learning* - is using the time-series features, feed into MLP, and extract the output vectors as *temporal embedding*
- *Spatial Learning* - is to feed the subgraph into [[0_pages/05/GNN Convolution|GCN]] to learn Nodes Embeddings of each County

### Skip Connection Models

A *skip connection* is used to preserve the original feature of the Temporal Embedding along the learning process: 
- this allows the original time-series persists along with Nodes
- avoid diluting the original time-series features

It is done by: 
- concat time-series embedding into every layer of [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-04-47-45300|convolution]]
- using a *Spectral Normalised* version of [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-17-06-58-65100|adjacency matrix]] ($\tilde{A}$) to allow Nodes to connect itself (i.e., consider itself as it's own neighbour)

## Performance Comparison

### Metrics
- RMSL(og)E - overall models‚Äô regression error
- Correlation - predicted day to prev day correlation (maybe [[Autocorrelation]])

### Performance
- Models with ‚ÄúMobility Summary‚Äù slight better
- GNN & Seq Models (with Mobility) better
- High AC in all models; High AC in case change in GNN and Seq2Seq

### Additional Patterns
- early stage of COVID - ARIMA  models perform better; this might because many got infected & mobility play less role (reflected in high AC)
- later stage - NN models perform better, this might because infection control & mobility play significant role in the modelling process

## Reflections

1. GNN perform slightly better
	- TS of root nodes are modified by Neighbours Features
	- However the **model doesn't actually include mobility in modelling** (i.e., in-out flow links feature) the embeddings
	- **Time-series of Neighbours hasn't been learnt**, so the boarder trend among neighbours are missed

2. LSTM & Seq2Seq Performance
	- relatively small model
	- Nodes‚Äô relationship are difficult to include 
		- This is because of *permutation invariant*, such that Neighbours Nodes cannot be effectively fixed into a specific columns and learnt as column features
	- could try to **mitigate this by adding ‚Äúaggregated‚Äù neighbours‚Äô** features? 

3. Benefits of using GNN
	- one benefit of using GNN to model time-series problem is that it allow the models to extend to use other features that can only be represented as graphs. 
	- this allows more non-tabular features to be included when modelling time-series

## Possible Improvement

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230223232625.png]]
The model could be improved in several ways: 
- replace the basic MLP time-series model with a recurrent model like [[LSTM]]
- take the link features (inflow & outflow mobility) into consideration, this can be done by extending [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-19-48-97800#Edge Neighbours Messages Passing|edge neighbours Messages Passing]]
- using [[Temporal GNN]] as a way to learn from **multiple layers of graphs** instead of a single day. This can allow the model to take the time-series of Neighbours into consideration as well
