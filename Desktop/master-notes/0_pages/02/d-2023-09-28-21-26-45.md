*Dependency Inversion* simply means: 
- there are no direct class dependency, only with Interfaces/ Abstractions

There are some implications on this: 

- client doesn't need to know the details, so long it **knows how to get the right inputs**
- each Class **can be replaced**, so long it keeps the right Interface, it won't affect others
- each class can be **testable**, it we can mock it with the same Interface

## Anti-Pattern without Inversion

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-28-21-45#^no-inversion]]

In a design with no dependency inversion, every class are directly linked with its dependency. One problem here is: 
1. if there is a change in System C (replacement/ patches/ new usages)
2. System A might be affected and needs update (directly dependency)
3. System B might be affected and needs update (same reason)

Without dependency inversion, **one change in a system might create chain reaction on all the others**.

## Replaceable Systems 

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-28-21-45#^replaceable]]

One benefit of dependency inversion is that systems can be replaced easily, e.g.,: 
- old System C can be replaced into a new System C (even with a new usages)
- System A and System B only depends on its Interface to interact with System C
- the scope of change only resides within the new System C, e.g., 
	- [[d-2023-09-18-22-13-28|adapting]] the new system to the existing interface
	- ensure it generates the same outputs for the interface when accessed

## Testable Systems

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-28-21-45#^testable]]

Dependency Inversion also makes system *testable*. E.g., a Mock System C can be created when testing System A, which: 
- **limits the testing scope** to the logics within System A only, as it assumes System C always generate the right outputs, 
- **no need for extra efforts to build up** the entire System C for testing, we can just create a simple mocking system to substitute
