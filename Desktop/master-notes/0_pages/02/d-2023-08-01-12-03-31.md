## Data Silo Problem

When staging/ managing data processes through a *Centralised Data Storages*. Different teams usually need to **create various independent [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-06-00-01-12#Core Components|Data Marts]] to process their own data**. Although data proximity is closer, this also creates *Data Silo Problem*, which makes the following difficult: 
- difficult to perform cross-functions analytics
- additional ETL efforts to mirror data across different data marts
- additional cost for storing additional mirrored data & inefficient use of scaled computed resources
- large up-front cost for centralised data storage & data marts scaling
- additional admin works to share data

Under the [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-04-27-31600|Snowflake Architecture]], the problems caused by Data Silos can be resolved by:
- Reduce expensive cost/ query on Centralise Database - Snowflake has efficient methods to enable efficient distributed sharing
- removed additional efforts for "mirroring silo" - Each Team can still maintain their own "silo" under different [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-22-05-18-97000#üíΩ Database Object|databases]], while data sharing across teams is simply a management of [[0_pages/05/d-2023-07-27-14-33-24|accesses models]]
- remove cost in scaling - scaling cost for accessing other Team's databases are reduced, as this can be dynamically [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-22-03-16-44600|scaled]] based on actual compute usage
