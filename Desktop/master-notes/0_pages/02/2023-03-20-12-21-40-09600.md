# Starting Poetry Project 

The following steps showcase how to start a *Poetry*  project and create an virtual environment: 

### 1. Start a Project

```shell
poetry init  # with existing project 
poetry new <myProject>  # with new project + template
```

### 2. (Optional) - Create a `.venv` folder
When using editors like VS Code which depends on virtual env folder at the project root, this can be created by using: 

```bash
# add .venv inside the project dir
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

---
## Create Venv & Shell

```shell
# set an appropriate version with pyenv
pyenv install -l

# poetry to use the install pyenv version
poetry env use $(pyenvRoot)/versions/{VERSION}/bin/python
```

---
## Installing Project as Package

We can use poetry to package the projects into wheels *artefacts*. 

```shell
poetry build  # this create .whl 
source .venv/bin/activate  # start any virtual env
pip3 install ./dist/<package>.whl
```

Then we can import it just like other pip installed libraries
