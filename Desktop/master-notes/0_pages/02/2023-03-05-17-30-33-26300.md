# Spark Cluster Architectures 


## Cluster Mode 

![[1_catalog/14/2022-12-25-15-40#^37f129]]

The most common approach to deploy Spark application is through a *Cluster Mode*. In this mode, all of the [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-17-21-15-09800|Spark Processes]] under the same Cluster Network and assigned in different Nodes. 

1. Scripts and configs are compiled and deploy through `spark-submit` to a Cluster Manager service of a running Cluster
2. Cluster Manager assign one Worker Node as Spark Driver Process and some other Worker Nodes as Executors
3. Node hosting Driver Process exposes network with Nodes hosting Executors, so that it can allocate tasks and receive results from them

### ✅  Pros
This architecture is the simplest to maintain and deploy because everything are within a Cluster Network, which makes the deployments only need to concern with a single entry point (the Cluster Manager) and one set of network (the Cluster Network).

## Client Mode

![[1_catalog/14/2022-12-25-15-40#^c43c70]]

Another Mode to deploy application to Cluster is through a *Client Mode*. In this mode, only the Spark Executors are running in a Cluster Network (i.e., only tasks computation are run in Cluster) while the Driver is hosted outside the Cluster in a local network.

1. Deployment using `spark-submit` on a server network of a machine that hosts the Driver Process
2. Cluster Network are setup independently by explicitly assigning number of Worker Nodes and configure each Node to connect to the Driver Process's network
3. Driver Process allocate tasks to Executors


### ✅  Pros
The benefit of this is that the Driver and Executors are using separate networks, which allows [[Edge Computation]]. This makes it possible to allow certain [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|partition]] of the data (e.g., location-based partitions) being stored in another location's network, make accessing particular data quicker than through a network.
