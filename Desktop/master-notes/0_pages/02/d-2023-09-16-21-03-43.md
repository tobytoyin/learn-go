There are several common approach to test and deploy application in AWS: 
- *blue/ green deployment* - separate two AWS accounts to test features
- *canary deployment* - test features by separating different versions

## Blue Green Deployment

A *blue/ green deployment strategy* is a good way to fully test whether an application is entirely production-ready in two separate environments (commonly two accounts). 

One way to do this is to use [[0_pages/04/d-2023-08-26-12-22-55|Route 53]] and assigned a *weighted routing*. This allows the DNS to randomly route small portion of users to the "Green" environment with the "latest features"; while developers can actively monitor whether there are issues regarding to that before fully deploy that as a "stable version".

## Canary Deployment

For a simpler application (e.g., API endpoints), one approach is to use *canary deployment*. This also uses weighted routing within the AWS API Gateway to randomly assign portion of users to an experimental API endpoint, while keeping most users to the stable endpoint. 

This approach is suitable for light weight applications and uses "versions" to route traffics, and reduce the complexity in setting up multiple separated accounts.
