# Elastic Container Services

## 📠 VM vs Containers 

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20221128132416.png|600]]

When hosting application on a virtual machines like [[0_pages/02/d-2023-11-07-20-55-47|EC2]], it usually involves booting up a fully operating OS for complex workflows. 

For many Linux based application, like web servers, we only **need a light weighted system** and required efficient scaling; launching a full VM would lead to lots of unused overheads. We can use container services to handle this.

## 🏗️  EC2 & Containers Architecture

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230605103531.png]]

Containers in AWS can be deployed to EC2 instances instead of using one instance to host one application. Containers are deployed to an instance. The scaling & maintenance of containers are done within a single EC2 instance

When working with a cluster of compute instances, an *EC2 cluster* can be deployed and maintain using [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Kubernetes]].

The containers' Images are stored in *Elastic Container Registry (ECR)*.

## 🎻 Containers in EC2

If we have to maintain our own containers orchestration, it would be very cumbersome. This needs developing & hosting an custom controller to control and orchestrate containers in EC2 - scaling; monitoring; deploying; networking, etc.

*Elastic Container Services* (ECS) simplifies this by wrapping containers with an AWS managed agent. AWS manages the orchestration of containers (like docker engine) within an EC2 instance. 

*Elastic Kubernetes Services* (EKS) provides a similar managed cluster. It provides a managed [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700|Kubernetes cluster]] that uses EC2 instances as Kubernetes' computing resources (i.e., driver & workers).
