## Pod's Private Network

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230102215526.png|500]]

Every [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700#üíä Pod|Pods]] in the cluster is a self-contained "application" and contains their own private *Restricted Network*. This is maintained by Pods' *virtual IP Address*, which is only accessible by the Control Panel. 

Each Pod contains:  
- an unique virtual IP address, exposes to others within the cluster
- external traffics cannot communicate directly to Pods but need to route through the Control Panel as an entry point

## K8s Service? 

To expose the Pod's networks to others and enable network traffics, this requires Pods to attach to a *Service* (`svc`). 

Formally by K8s definition: 
> A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

Essentially, a network Service among Pods is based on: 
- grouping Pods that should shared network together ([[#Labels & LabelSelector]]) 
- defining how networks are shared within the group ([[#IP Exposure]])

## Labels & LabelSelector

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230103110140.png|500]]

To define a Service, K8s uses *Label* to tag Pods and group them together. This "label grouping" define a set of Pods as one [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-23-21-57-15700#ü™û ReplicaSet|ReplicaSet]]. Network traffics are routed to those labelled Pods using *LabelSelector*. 

For example, if an application contains a Service called `userAuth`: 
- Pods that run this service can be labelled as `endpoint: userAuth`
- for other Pods to route traffics to this Service, it uses LabelSelector to search for a Service that is labelled as `endpoint: userAuth`

## IP Exposure

In a Service, there might have Pods that are responsible only for backend processes & Pods that are responsible for traffics handling. 

A "*ServiceSpec*" defines the rules of network traffics to flow into a Service, e.g: 
- which Pod's IP address should be exposed and accept inbound traffics
- which Pod's IP address can communicate within the Service (Routing)

Three common type of Services Spec are: 

> [!example]- *ClusterIP* (default)
> - creates an internal/ virtual IP within the cluster. This IP is only recognisable within cluster, so this ==enable traffic between cluster's Pods but not to the outside world==. 

> [!example]- *NodePort*
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230103114306.png]]
> - exposes the IP of the Nodes that are hosting the Pods; Node's Port to expose those Service's Pods. This partially exposes the hardware (Node) to the outside world but only allow traffic through specific Ports. 
^node-port

> [!example]- *LoadBalancer*
> ![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230103113012.png]]
> - making NodePort Service as a ReplicaSet
> - spreading traffics (i.e., load balancing) to different Services IP
