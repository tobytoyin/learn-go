Because a single [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|MapReduce]] task can only handle one simple computation by using one Mapper and one Reduce Function. More complex computation, e.g., various joins > aggregation > sorts, usually depends on multiple Jobs and Workflow to make complex computation. 
At each stage of the Workflow/ Job, it would generate an intermediate MapReduce result for the next one, then consecutively combine into the result of a complex computation.

## MapReduce Workflow


A Job is a computation that ends with one MapReduce operation. Each Job would generate a temporary result file that feed as inputs for the next Job. A whole chain of Jobs composes as a Workflow (or Batch Job).

When a Workflow is completed, it would write the results back to storage (file system). Since Workflow are computed consecutively, any intermediate Jobs would lead the whole Batch Job fail without partial success files.

  

> [!note]- Hadoop Jobs
> Hadoop MapReduce doesn't have Workflow and can only compute Jobs. Therefore, every MapReduce will write intermediate outputs into the file system's directory and the next Jobs are configured to read from them.

## Workflow Scheduler

When Batch Jobs combine intertwining, it relies on Workflow Scheduler to manage the data flow, e.g., triggering next Workflow after certain Workflow(s). This ensure Batch Processing conduct the computation with all its needed.


> [!example]-
> For example, we can have Batch Jobs for different stores that compute the sales and expenses; online sales. A Workflow Scheduler would determine that "Store Net Income" Workflow should only be started when both "Store-based" and "Online-based" Sales Batch Jobs are fully completed.
