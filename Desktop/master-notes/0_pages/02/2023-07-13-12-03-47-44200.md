An [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800#Composition Design ("HAS-A" relationship)|Interface]] defines an abstraction of methods/ attributes that a function can reliably access to without knowing the details of each implementation (i.e., `struct`). This allow a function to interact with any kind of `struct`, as long as the `struct` follows the same template as indicated by the `interface`.


For example: 
- we have multiple [[0_pages/02/2023-04-15-14-55-46-43900|struct]] - `Circle.area()`, `Square.area()`, etc...
- an `interface` allows the programme to abstract that both `Circle` and `Square` as `Shape`. And all `Shape` has there own `area()` method. 
- allowing the code be more extendable to more new `Shape`

## Constructing Interface

> [!Tip]- no formal extension
> In other OOP languages, implementations need to explicitly extending an `interface`, e.g., `class Implementation(InterfaceClass)`. This is not required in Go. 

In Go, implementations of `interface` are infer implicitly. This means a `struct` doesn't require a formal extension of an interface: 
- implement all `interface` methods & fields
- having the right [[0_pages/03/2023-03-20-12-19-29-31000|functional signature]] of the method

```go
// define an abstract interface
type Shape interface {
	area() float64
}

// function that uses the Interface 
// instead of concrete implementation
func sumOfAreas(shape ...Shape) float64 {
	var area float64
	for _, s += range shapes {
		area += shape.area()  // access the interface method
	}
	return area
}
```

In here, we expects struct that contains method `area() -> float64` as an valid implementation of this interface. For example: 

```go
// Circle struct and its area() method
type Circle struct {
	radius float64
}

func (circle *Circle) area() float64 {
	return math.Pi * math.Pow(2, circle.radius)
}

// Square struct and its area() method
type Square struct {
	length float64
}

func (square *Square) area() float64 {
	return math.Pow(2, square.length)
}
```

## Testing Interface

Because interface in Go doesn't have a direct dependent, the way to test if some function is returning an `interface` probably is by this the behaviour/ output of the implemented interface.
