## Motivation

When building Python application, it is good at think about how to **decouple logics as a separate API**, e.g., how would one application code makes request to another. This kind of decoupling is useful to:

- build Microservices architecture using [[0_pages/03/d-2023-08-25-13-48-49|Unit of Work Pattern]]
- use Docker [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-13-21-50-14|container]] to decouple and reduce the size of application
- allow engineers to work on different services to separate concerns
- allow Backend API to switch to different logics without affect the Frontend

For example: 
- `client` makes request to `backend` to filter, compute a database
- `client` makes request to `backend` to use a LLM

## Example Design

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-09-27-20-35#^design]]

We have a very simple architecture for this Flask API: 
- a container hosting `backend` that returns a `GET` response
- a container hosting `client` that make`GET` request to `backend`; return a response
- a `driver:bridge` network to allow two independent containers to communicate

The last point is important because each container has different IP addresses for its `localhost`, this would need a shared network to allow the containers to communicate. 

---
## Folder Tree

```shell
├── backend
│   ├── dockerfile
│   ├── src
│   │   └── app.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── client
│   ├── dockerfile
│   ├── src
│   │   └── app.py
│   └── requirements.txt
└── docker-compose.yml
```

- `./backend` stores the backend API source code and a dockerfile for the build
- `./client` stores the backend consumer source code and a dockerfile for the build
- `docker-compose.yml` uses docker-compose to build both services together

---
## Backend Code

The backend code is a simple `GET` route to return a hello world message: 

```python
@app.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def main():
    res = {
        "status_code": 200,
        "message": "hello world",
        "source": "backend",
    }
    return jsonify(res)
```

---
## Client Code

Client code is a `GET` route which will then make a `GET` request to the `backend` API to get the hello world message:

```python
# switch betwween container mode $HOMENAME, or localhost mode
backend_url = os.environ.get("URL", "localhost")
backend_host = f"http://{backend_url}:8080"


@app.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def main():
    # make a request to our backend api
    try:
        res = requests.get(backend_host).json()
        res = {**res, "source": "client"}

    except Exception as exc:
        res = {
            "status_code": 400,
            "exc": exc,
        }

    # return the data to the webpage
    return jsonify(res)

```

There are some key notes herein: 
- `backend_host` - is dynamically switching between `localhost` and `URL` environment variable. When this code is using a "non-container mode", `localhost` can make a proper request to the machine's own IP. While in the "container mode", this needs to be the *virtual IP address* of `backend` container, i.e., `http://<container_name>:<port>`.

## Compose Walkthrough

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # build the backend container
  backend:
    build: ./backend/
    container_name: flask-backend
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    networks:
      - api-network

  # build the client container, which access from backend      
  client:
    build: ./client/
    container_name: flask-client
    environment:
      - URL=flask-backend  # same as the backend's container_name
    ports:
      - 8082:8082
    networks:
      - api-network

networks:
  # create a network to allow client to request backend
  api-network: 
    driver: bridge
```

- `backend`
	- expose its `8080` port within the container local network
	- attach it to the `api-network` to allow ingress request from `client`
- `client`
	- expose its `8082` port within the container local network
	- attach it to the `api-network` to allow egress request to `backend`
	- passing an env var `URL` which is the same as the `container_name` for `backend` to connection within Docker's virtual IP
- `networks.api-network` - build a one-to-one bridge network between `backend` and `client` to share network flow
