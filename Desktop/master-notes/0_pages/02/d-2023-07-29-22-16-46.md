A *Fanout Pattern* in AWS Lambda aims to allow Lambda functions to be executed in [[0_pages/03/d-2023-07-02-10-25-33|asynchronously]] from a sequential (or cascading) Lambda executions.

Instead of using a single Lambda as the entry point to process a payload, it relies on using [[SNS Topics]] as a hub to store the payload temporarily and "fanout" the payload into multiple Lambdas asynchronously.

## SQS Fanout Pattern

As SQS can only be polled 1000 messages at a time ([here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-queues.html)), the Fanout pattern can also be applied using multiple SQS queues to consume large amount of messages fronted by SNS. This can increase the amount of parallelisation:
