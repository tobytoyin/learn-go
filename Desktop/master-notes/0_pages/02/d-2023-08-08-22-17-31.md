*Data Cluster* (*Clustered Table*) is a approach to further group and cluster [[0_pages/02/2023-05-01-12-02-15-27800|Micro-Partitioned data]] of a Table into a set of columns as *cluster keys*. 

> [!Tip]
> This is similar to [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-12-01-86700|partitioning]] built on tops of Snowflake Micro-partitions instead of Records.

## Clustering Width

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-08-08-22-36#^cluster-width]]

*Cluster Width* measures the *Rows Overlaps* among micro-partitions. This is micro-partitioned further compresses all the Rows into columnar Tables. There exists overlapping row data that exist in both single columnar Table.

## Cluster Depth

![[1_catalog/14/c-2023-08-08-22-36#^cluster-depth]]

*Cluster Depth* measures the *Columns Overlaps* among micro-partitions for a specific clustering key, i.e., how many micro-partitions shared the same cluster-keyed column. For example, if the cluster key is: 
- column 1 - depth = 3
- column 2 - depth = 1
- column 3 - depth = 1

## Data Cluster Efficiency

An efficient data clustering allows Snowflake to scan fewer clusters (lower overlapping) to get the required micro-partitions into the warehouses for compute. This can be measured by **degrees of micro-partitions overlaps** and generally the lower the better (both Width & Depth)
- more micro-partitions overlapped in one cluster key, the less efficient 
- fewer micro-partitions overlapped in one cluster key, the more efficient

## Controlling Width & Depth

### Controlling Width 

This usually can be done by sorting Table properly before loading into permanent storage, thus allow Snowflake to conduct micro-partitioning better (since this is automatically sharding based on rows order).

### Controlling Depth

Depth can be controlled by analysing which cluster-key to select. This generally can follow how to select the optimal partitioned key in traditional partitioning; determine whether it is [[0_pages/02/2023-10-10-23-59-37-82500|storage/ query optimisation]]
