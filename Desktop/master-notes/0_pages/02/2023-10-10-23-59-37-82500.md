## Query-first Partitioning

A "query-first" approach is suitable for analytic applications and data warehouse. These kind of partitions ==focuses on how certain analytics services query large amount of data efficiently== (i.e., retrieval large amount of relevant records with minimal comparison of individual record's values).
For example, analytics queries that commonly needs to conduct group-by or filter operations, we could partition data into some commonly grouped categorical typed columns.
