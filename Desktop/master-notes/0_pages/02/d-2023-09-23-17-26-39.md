# üìì Creating a Diff Sets in Github Actions 

## Variables Explanations

- `sha` - every Git commit is represented by a hashed SHA
	- `${{ github.event.before }}` - for SHA of last commit of this branch
	- `${{ github.sha }}` - for SHA of this commit 
- `git diff <compare_with> <target>` - is used to find the code diff sets by compare two commits (indicated by `sha`)
- `${{ steps.changes.outputs.files }}` - reference the Github Actions Outputs of each step, specifically we reference the outputs from the step with Step ID `changes`

## Spec

```yaml
name: "Get Diff Set in Repo"
on: push

jobs:
  changedfiles:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      files: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.files }}

    steps:
      # Make sure we have some code to diff.
      - name: Checkout by cloning last 2 commits
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: Get changed files
        id: changes
        run: |
          LAST_COMMIT_SHA=${{ github.event.before }}
          THIS_COMMIT_SHA=${{ github.sha }}
          CHANGES=$( git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRT $LAST_COMMIT_SHA $THIS_COMMIT_SHA )
          echo "files=$CHANGES" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo $CHANGES
```

### Steps
1. Checkout and cloning the repo by fetch the last 2 commits (`fetch-depth: 2`)
2. Use `git diff` to get what files are being modified, once the file names are collected that are output into the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` file under `files`. 
3. Once these steps are done, the `GITHUB_OUTPUT` can be referenced and export as `outputs` of the `jobs.changedfiles` Job (see [[0_pages/03/d-2023-09-23-16-37-28|Github Actions Outputs]])
