## Defining Struct

`struct` represents an object that group different objects together and define as a new data type in the programme (as in `class` in most OOP).

```go
// defining a Person struct datatype
type Person struct {
	// below are the fields (attribs) of Person 
	Name string
	Age int
	Score float32
	StrStrMap map[string]string
	StrAnyMap map[string]interface{}
}
```

## Initialisation of Struct

Just like every generic variables in Go, a `struct` type can be assigned into a variable as both [[0_pages/02/2023-04-10-16-06-41-06100|Pointer]] (reference to the actual data) or as Copy of the data:

### Initialise as variable Copy

```go
var defaultPerson Person  // init with default args

myPerson := Person("timmy", 30, 80.0)  // init with inputs args

// >> both return as copied object {name age score}
```

### initialise as variable Pointer

```go
defaultPersonPtr := new(Person)  // init with default args

myPerson := &Person{"tommy", 40, 90.0}  // init with inputs args

// >> both return as Pointers &{name age score}
```

## Methods

When interacting with `struct`, the simplest function could just take accept a struct object as an input argument: 

```go
myObj = new(myStruct)

// an ordinary function
func someFunction(s *myStruct) {
	// do something on s.field
}

// to use it
someFunction(myObj)  
```

*Methods* in `struct` is created by extending a struct type with a new function using a *receiver*. This receiver is add before the pointer of the `struct` to indicate an extension of it: 

```go
myObj = new(myStruct)

// a struct method
func (s *myStruct) someMethod() {
	// do something on s.field
}

// to use it
myObj.someMethod()  
```
