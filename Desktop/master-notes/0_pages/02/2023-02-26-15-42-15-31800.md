A Machine Learning Model often outputs data that can be mapped back to the original tabular database. For example: 

![[3_hidden/_images/machine-learning-db-20221218175129.png|500]]

- database's unique records are used to train a ML model
- ML model makes prediction on each unique record
- prediction values can be mapped back to each record as a "prediction" column

## üëéüèª The Not So Good Way

![[3_hidden/_images/not-so-good-way-20221218175555.png]]

One approach in using a Machine Learning Model's outputs created by MapReduce is to take each Predictions created by MapReduce and then write it back to the original database (i.e., writing a new prediction value back to the Record ID). 

Then the Client would send read query to the database to retrieve the Record's data along side with its prediction values.

However, this approach is not a effective use of MapReduce because a batch processing system would have lots of data (many Rows/ Records) and lots of data writes would increase the throughput rate of the database and impact performance.

## üîë Key-Value Stores

![[3_hidden/_images/distributed-storage-20221218181245.png]]

To better utilise MapReduce parallelism without impacting the performance of the database. MapReduce predictions can simply be written into a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-05-17-27-33-82100|Distributed Storage]] that stores every predictions by Key-Value (==each prediction has a key of the unique ID in the original database, prediction as its value==). 

This approach reduce high-writes to database and the need to change database's schema for an additional prediction column.

## Requesting to Database & Predictions

Request the record's data and it's predictions is different from the traditional approach. Instead of making a single read query to a database, a client needs to make two separate requests: 
- request to database to read data of certain "record ID"
- request to a distributed file system of certain "record ID". Then file system makes [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-15-41-40-19700|Distributed Requests]] to different partitions to look for the stored partitions of the "record ID"
