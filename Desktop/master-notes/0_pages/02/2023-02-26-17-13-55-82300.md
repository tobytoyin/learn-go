# Python - Partial Function 

A *Partial Function* (`functools.partial`) is a way to "partially" construct a fully callable function subsequently during runtime. 

For example, the below function is fully constructed with all the required arguments and fully callable:

```python
def func(a, b):
	return a + b

x = func(a=10, b=10)
```

A Partial Function makes it possible to construct a callable function by passing arguments separately. 
```python 
p1 = partial(func, a=10)  # add in arg a
p2 = partial(p1, b=10)    # add in arg b
x = p2()   # finally all args are presented and call it
```

## Why use Partial?

Partial Function is useful when the values for the arguments are scattered along the runtime, which would make it inefficient/ expensive to: 
- retain all the data until we gather all the values for the functional arguments
- pass around "data storing" objects everywhere

Instead of hoarding all the data, we "partially" construct a function until all arguments are gathered.

### > Anti-pattern Example

 For example, in this API request code:
```python
var_needed = {}

# --- stage 1 
payload1 = some_api_request(url)
var_needed['a'] = payload1['a']

# --- stage 2
payload2 = some_api_request(url2)
var_needed['b'] = payload2['b']

# --- func call stage
result = func(**var_needed)
```
At each stage, we might obtain some values that satisfied the function partially. An anti-pattern of doing this to keep track of data using some `dict`, however t==he function is now implicitly dependent== on the `dict`.

### > Partial Function Example
Instead of making the function being dependent on a `dict`. `partial` ==allows the functions to stay independent and avoid unnecessary coupling==. 
```python
# --- stage 1 
payload1 = some_api_request(url)
func_stage1 = partial(func, a=payload1['a'])

# --- stage 2
payload2 = some_api_request(url2)
func_stage2 = partial(func_stage1, b=payload1['b'])

# --- func call stage
resut = func_stage2()
```

## Usage along with Observer Pattern

A more advanced usage for this can be used along with [[0_pages/05/2023-02-26-14-29-00-32500|Observer Pattern]]. We can have the observer to constantly monitor if we gather all the required variables: 
- when new variables are passed into `partial`, *notify* the Observer
- Observer *checks if all the arguments are gathered* 
- partial function is *called* by Observer when the above checks satisfy
