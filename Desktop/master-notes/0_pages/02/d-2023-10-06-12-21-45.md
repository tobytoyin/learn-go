AWS *CloudHSM* is a managed single-tenant hardware which allow accounts to store data in a dedicated hardware in AWS data centre.

While other [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-14-04-20-60100|AWS Storages]] use a "multi-tenant model" and data from different accounts are stored together in the same hardware, CloudHSM uses a "single tenant model" for a specific account.

## Storing Private Keys

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231029222757.png]]^private-key-usage

One common use case for CloudHSM is to store [[0_pages/02/d-2023-08-26-12-56-05|Private Keys]] in CloudHSM to meet data compliance. This approach is similar to storing Private Keys in on-premise hardwares but instead use CloudHSM. 

This approach makes integrations with [[wip/d-2023-10-29-23-22-23|KMS]] more seamless, as KMS can access the key automatically from CloudHSM for decryption. Whereas using an on-premise hardware requires users to provide the Private Keys to the KMS session for decryption.
