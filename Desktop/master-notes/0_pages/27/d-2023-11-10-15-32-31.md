In our [[0_pages/95/d-2023-11-10-14-53-37|Simple Logstash Pipeline]], we relies on outputting the data based on the default schema defined by Logstash. However, we might want to define how custom schema for our outputs: 

---
## Input 

```txt
[INFO] Hello World
[INFO] Hello World Again
[ERROR] Some Error in this application
```

---
## Pipeline

```ruby
input {
  file {
    path => "..."  # source of the log 
    mode => "read"  # read the logs
    start_position => "beginning"

    sincedb_clean_after => 0
    file_completed_action => "log"
    file_completed_log_path => "..."
  }
}

# "output" destination of the log
output {
  stdout { codec => "json" }
  
  file {
    path => "...json"
    codec => line {
      format => '{"my_message": "%{message}"}'
    }
  }

}
```

In the `codec => line {...}`, we construct the format of the output.

---
## Output

```json
{"my_message": "[INFO] Hello World Again"}
{"my_message": "[INFO] Hello World"}
{"my_message": "[ERROR] Some Error in this application"}
```
