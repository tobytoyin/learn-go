It is common for a function in Go to return a value along with any errors during the function execution (aka *Error Returning Function*). This type of function is commonly used for: 

- [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-02-13-18-40-503|Partial Failure Mechanism]] - having application to skip operation rather than kill the entire application
- Default Value - having the function to return certain default values when facing error, and let the downstream function to decide what to do with it

## Function Example


```go
func OneDividedByNumber(x float64) (float64, error) {
	if x == 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("divide by zero error")
	} else {
		return 1 / x, nil
	}
}


result, err := OneDividedByNumber(10.0)
```
