A *Logstash Pipeline* is an ETL process that consists of three stages: 
- E - `input`
- T - `filter`
- L - `output`

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20231115122352.png]]
Each pipeline is setup as a "configuration file" to run on a set of predetermined input source.

## Completion Acknowledgement

Like many [[0_pages/05/2023-04-07-12-38-26-29900|events streaming systems]], Logstash relies on two ways to acknowledge message delivery is completed (`file_completed_action`):
- (default) input sources data is deleted after completion
- completed records are captured in `sincedb`

## Outputs

Logstash uses `output` to define to stash output locations. There are some key takeaways:
- it is only responsible in writing to the destination, this expects the output resources/ directory already exists

## Filter 

- [[0_pages/24/d-2023-11-10-18-05-43|Regex & Grok]] for pattern matching and Fields population
- [[0_pages/47/d-2023-11-11-22-03-36|Mutate]] for changing, adding, transforming, updating Fields
