A *Pod* is a **smallest deployment unit** for Worker Nodes deployment. **A Pod defines of a collection of [[0_pages/05/d-2023-10-13-21-50-14|Containers]]** and are [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-23-21-41-91300#⚙️ Worker Nodes Processes|set up on a running Node]]. This is essentially the "container" that "containerising other containers". ==A single Pod is often defined as a single application that is tightly coupled by multiple micro application containers==.

## Pod & Processing Scaling

Abstraction of containers into Pod is efficient for scaling and has a better utilisation of compute resources of within a Node.

## Pods as a Single Service

Containers bundle in a Pod usually can be used as a single independent application. For example, a Pod can contain multiple containers, which: 

- one application container for the application logics
- one support container to as cache database for the application

This structuring approach allows all the containers in the Pod to share the same network, i.e., they can communicate with each others through `localhost`. In which the `localhost` represents the Pod's private network.
