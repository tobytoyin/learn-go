## VNet & Subnet

In AWS, instance group needs to be wrapped within a [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630|VPC and Subnet]]. In Azure, VM also needs to be wrapped with a Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet:

## Instance Firewall (Security Group)

In AWS, [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-05-22-41-21-618|Security Group]] (SG) is created by default when provisioning EC2 instances and automatically associates with an instance. 

In Azure, SG is required to be provisioned separately and associates with a Subnet independently. This is more similar to [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-05-22-41-21-618|AWS NACL]] as it provides a subnet level network controls.

## Disk Storage

In AWS disk storages for compute instances are optional, as each instance contains a default [[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-09-18-41-54|instance storage]]. Additional [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-14-04-20-60100|permanent storages]] are service specifics, e.g., S3 for Object Storage, EBS for Disk Storage.

In Azure, all kinds of storages (Object, Disk, Files storages, etc.) are unified under a single *[[0_pages/76/d-2023-11-15-12-27-06|Azure Storage Account]]*. VM instance is required to attach to a storage account to access disk storage.
