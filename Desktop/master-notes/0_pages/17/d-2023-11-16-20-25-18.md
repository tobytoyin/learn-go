## ReplicaSet

In a distributed system, we might want to maintain a resilient system under certain scenarios: 
- maintain a consistent amount of Pods in times of having failing Pods
- scale up the application to meet usage capacity

These kinds of processes relies on the use of *ReplicaSet*, acting as the cluster's template to maintain a "Desired State" in other to keep the cluster consistent and scalable. From K8s documentation:

> A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. 

A ReplicaSet essentially provides a template to answer the above question: 
- what is the *desired/ minimum amount of Pods* a cluster required?
- *how many Pods* to create/ delete, for each scaling action?

## LabelSelector & ReplicaSet

Since a cluster would contain many different [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|Services]] or logical groups, it would be useful to **only deploy/ scale a specific set of ReplicaSet**. For example, we might have a cluster that hosts: 
- set of Pods running frontend containers
- set of Pods running backend containers

A system might selectively choose to replicate only frontend/ backend Pods depending on different scenarios.

A ReplicaSet requires a definition of [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-23-24-13-54500|selector label]] as a way to define different groups of ReplicaSet, allowing K8s controller to determine which ReplicaSet to deploy based on different scenarios. For example: 
- more frontend traffics → deploy more ReplicaSet with `frontend` selector
- more heavy computations → deploy more ReplicaSet with `backend` selector

## Specification File

The YAML specification declaratively describes the above scenarios: 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  # number of Pods to replicate
  replicas: 3  
  
  # use the template, when deployment actions is applied
  # to the selector's labels
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend 
      
  template:
	  ##### >> Pod Spec << #####
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3
    ##### >> End of Pod Spec << #####
```
