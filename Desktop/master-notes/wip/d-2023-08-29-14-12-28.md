## Latent Costs

[[0_pages/02/d-2023-11-07-20-55-47|EC2]] can involves different "hidden costs" based on the resources the instances attached to: 
- [[0_pages/02/d-2023-07-09-18-41-54|EBS Volume]] - Disks-related costs are incurred for data storages for the EC2, even when instances are not running, data storages in EBS would still involve costs (as in a running database)
- Elastics IP created for the instances - they are charged as "reserved IP addresses" even when instances are not running. This requires manually releasing those IP addresses.
