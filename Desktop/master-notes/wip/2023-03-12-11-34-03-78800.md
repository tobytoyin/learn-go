# üìì CNN

A *Convolution Neural Network* (CNN) follows a ‚Äúscan-zoom-scan-zoom‚Äù methodology in extracting features from images. It utilises many *filters*, as lens to scan for patterns within a picture; *convolution* as a rolling windows to look for patterns at different windows of pixels; and *pooling* as a compression of image/ patterns that are useful. 

This process is similar to how people use microscope. We first try to use the lens to scan over the images (convolution step); once we find some interesting pattern, we would need to capture and zoom in for further investigation (pooling step). by zooming in the image, we do the same process again.
