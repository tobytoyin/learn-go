## Benefits

Compare to this [[0_pages/01/2023-04-26-21-48-16-59400|example]], the benefit of this approach is:

	- `enum` maintenance falls onto the module registry side
	- class creation imports falls onto the `importlib`, which remove any static import and improve extendability by adding modules via third-party libraries
