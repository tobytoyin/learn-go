When using [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-17-13-11-48000|Key Range Partitioning]] to assign partition ID by rolling over strides, this process can be multiple threaded/ distributed. We need to answer these questions: 
- how large should an interval (stride) be?
- how to distribute Nodes to strides?

## One Node - One Interval

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230302231256.png|500]]^problem

XXX

It depends on that we know how large a table is, and we calucluate the interval ("stride")  based on the lowerBound and upperBound of the table. 

then the size of each interval is a simple cut based on the number of partitions: 
upperBound / partitions


XXX


One way to distribute this is by **assigning one Node to scan one Interval**. By using a KeyRange, the main question to "box-in" the Scan Interval is to know "**at which ID can the Interval capture N-Records?**"

In this illustration: 
- Rebalancer **needs to know how many records are available**, so that it can assign "cut intervals" for each Worker beforehand
	-  e.g., the Master knows there are 6 Records in total, so each Node can assign a 3 Records Interval
- Master Node assigns Worker 1 & 2 to scan for two intervals
	- whatever Worker 1 scanned → goes to partition ID 0
	- whatever Worker 2 scanned → goes to partition ID 1

### ⚠️ Drawbacks

For a managed databases, this approach would be feasible because Master Node can easily acquire logs/ index and use it to define proper interval cuts. As in Relational Table - "which Row ID can get me N-Records"

For multi-connection databases, the local system Master Node
- may not have information about the detail of the Table (e.g., full-size)
- may only knows about the Range (max-min) of the sorting Key
- *fuzzy range* like this makes it difficult for Rebalancer to parallelise. Because it may not know how to properly cut the values that can fit the size of the Interval

## One Interval - Multiple Nodes

![[3_hidden/_images/Pasted image 20230302231550.png|500]]^stride

Another approach is to parallelise Nodes as "Strides" to scan a subset of Table. Instead of finding the proper cut value that can fit the Interval:
- Rebalancer fetches a subset of Table - e.g., using sorted-rank Row ID
- since the *Fetched Table* is much smaller:
	- Master Node has all the information to do intervals rolling, i.e., how many rows to assign a partition ID
	- because a full-sized Interval may be too large for the Fetched Table, to minimise mis-assigning partition ID - the scan is done by smaller *Strides*
- *Strides* is **equivalently a smaller size & parallelised "mini-partitioning Intervals"**, which scan over the Fetched Table and assign partition ID
- repeat this again - by fetching the Table further


> [!NOTE] Variables
> - `fetchSize` - the size of the Fetched Table (subset of the full Table)
> - `strideSize` - the size of the Stride is `intervalWidth / numParts`
>

The main benefit of this Striding approach is that: 
- it removes the concern of finding which cut value within KeyRange can fit the partitioning Interval
- removes the concern of how big the Table, it is just recursively fetching 
- by sacrificing small amount of accuracy in assigning partition IDs

> [!Tip]
> This approach is basically what [[0_pages/01/2023-02-27-22-43-32-45400|Spark JDBC Parallel Read]] doing in other to parallelise & partition the read of an size-unknown full table.
