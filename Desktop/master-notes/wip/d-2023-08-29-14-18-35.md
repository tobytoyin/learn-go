*High Availability* in AWS indicates the concepts of: 
- allowing different AWS resources to interact resources with minimum boundaries 
- allowing different locations to interact with AWS resources efficiently
- mitigating service downtime (e.g., replications, [[0_pages/02/d-2023-08-10-12-04-08|efficient disaster recovery]])

## Global High Availability

- [[0_pages/04/2023-02-26-14-04-20-60100|S3]] - objects can be accessed globally anywhere to download and upload objects
- EFS - files can be accessed globally anywhere to download and upload files
- CloudFront - is globally available to allow data sharing and caching for edge locations, allowing media contents access with higher availability
- [[wip/d-2023-10-29-22-55-43|AWS Aurora]] - can be replicated globally in multi-regions, ensuring high service availability and close-to-none data loss
