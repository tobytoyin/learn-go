*Producer* can deliver messages based on three delivery methods: 

- At least once - a single message can be sent multiple times and duplicated. This only ensures message delivery but not uniqueness 
- At most once - a single message delivers only once regardless of whether the delivery is successful or not
- Exactly once - a single message can be sent multiple times and counted as "sent" when the consumer acknowledge it is delivered (ensure message single delivery)
