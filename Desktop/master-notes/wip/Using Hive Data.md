#data-warehouse 

Other than just retrieving data by running query against a [[0_pages/04/2023-03-11-15-35-31-07000#Tables|table]], there are several components we can use on Tables.

- Views - a **standardised** way to query a Table 
- Index - enhancing query **performance** of a Table
- Metastores - **communicating** with different Tables

## Views

While Table represents the actual data in a tabular form, Views represents a query that generate the tabular data, making it suitable to simplify complex query into parts.

The main difference is that Tables populate physical data, while views contains an abstraction of a Table without populating the data and only populates when being executed.
