A *Peering Connection* within networks all resources, data, network traffics travel among each others. This allows different separated networks to be used as if in a single unified network. 

*AWS VPC Peering* allows two [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630|VPCs]] to connect/ bridge with each others and allow networks/ data travels to each others as if they are in a single network. This has several benefits: 
- (micro)services/ applications can be decoupled & self-contained in a single VPC
- traffics among VPC's services are bounded within AWS and not publicly exposed
