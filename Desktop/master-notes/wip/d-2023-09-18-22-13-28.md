## When to use Adapter Pattern?

The goal of *Adapter Pattern* is to: 
- use another class that is incompatible but do the similar thing (*polymorphism* by making one class looks like a compatible interface)
- not about adding new functionalities but adding compatibility to what's working
- keep the adapter & adaptee classes compatible but uncoupled

## Object Adapter

*Object Adapter* aims to create adapter for `Client` using [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800|composition]]. In order word, `Client` interacts with an `Adapter` object that shares a Target Interface that `Client` knows how to access with: 

### Code Flow

1. `Client` interacts with an `Adapter` which has a method that is accessible by `Client`
2. `Adapter` build on top of & wrap around the `Adaptee`, eqv changing the namespace & signature of a method in `Adaptee` into `Adapter` class
