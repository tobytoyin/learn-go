In Go, type hinting usually requires a static typing. However by implementing a [[0_pages/03/2023-03-20-12-19-29-31000|Higher Order Functions]] in Go, we may not able to type hint the appropriate return types. For example: 

```python
def hof(x: int, fn: Callable[[int], Any]) -> Any:
	transform_x = transform(x)
	return fn(transform_x)  # this could return anything
```

To bypass the "Any" type annotation in Golang, we could use an [[0_pages/02/2023-07-13-12-03-47-44200|Interface]]. This indicates that the return type could be an unstructured interface object: 

```go
func hof(x int, func(int)) interface {
	transformX := transform(x)
	return func(transformX)
}
```
