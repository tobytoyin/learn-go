*Lambda Layers* are "modules" (packages) for different Lambda functions. The main reasoning to have functions packaged into Layers are: 

- modularity - to allow services sharing & reusability
- allow each Function being coherent as a single service (service entry point)
- decouple responsibilities (mainly as [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-14-28-36-77800|composition]] of functions)
- reduce scale of deployment
