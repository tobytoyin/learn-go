# RDD Transformation

---
   

RDD [[0_pages/03/2023-02-26-15-40-01-93300#Transformations|Transformations]] are essentially computation done on a single RDD instance within a single Partition. These transformations are mostly equivalent to *Single Record Computation* done within MapReduce [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|Mapping Stage]] & [[0_pages/02/2023-02-26-15-39-18-14900|Shuffling Stage]]. For example: 
- Mapper Stage Functions - `filter`, `map`
- Mapper Sort Stage - `sort`
- Shuffling Stage Functions - `randomSplit`

> [!NOTE]- Why `sort` can be done here?
> While a sorting function cannot be done on a single Record along, RDD allows `sort` to be a RDD transformation. This is because Spark retains the entire partition (RDD) in-memory, this allows sorting of data within a executor's partition.
