When accessing Snowflake data warehouses, it is by default that anyone with internet access can connect to a Snowflake account. 

Snowflake also provides a *Restricted Network Access* by using: 
- Virtual Private Network (VPN) - a private network tunnel to an account
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - a private network wrapping an account with other Cloud's resources (e.g., [[0_pages/02/d-2023-06-03-13-12-29-630|AWS VPC]])
